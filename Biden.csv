1691,Joe Biden,America is strongest when we lead with our values—at home and abroad.

1707,Joe Biden,Any final bill that looks anything like their proposals so far would be devastating.
1708,Joe Biden,Every patriotic American who is qualified to serve in our military should be able to serve. Full stop.
1709,Joe Biden,"The GOP's ""health"" plan would gut care &amp; treatment for opioid addiction. Call your senators—the time to act is now."

1725,Joe Biden,"Especially now, when so many communities are struggling with opioid addiction, the bill's drastic cuts to Medicaid are cruel."
1726,Joe Biden,"Slashing Medicaid hurts kids, the elderly, people with disabilities and those struggling with addiction. All for tax breaks for the wealthy."
1727,Joe Biden,The Senate health bill isn't about health care at all—it's a wealth transfer: slashes care to fund tax cuts for the wealthy &amp; corporations.
1728,Joe Biden,"America’s soul is rooted in the promise of opportunity. We must protect, support &amp; welcome refugees to keep that pr…"

1740,Joe Biden,It’s time to remember who we are as Americans: Giving EVERYONE the opportunity to achieve the impossible.
1741,Joe Biden,Our politics has become too small and petty. We’re better than this.
