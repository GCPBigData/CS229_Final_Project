1985,Elizabeth Warren,Republicans already tried slashing taxes for the rich in Kansas. It killed the state economy and working families paid the price.
1986,Elizabeth Warren,Republicans are relying on a few big lies to sell their awful tax plan. One is that slashing taxes for the rich will help working families.

1998,Elizabeth Warren,"Thoughts &amp; prayers are not enough, GOP. We must end this violence. We must stop these tragedies. People are dying while you wait."
1999,Elizabeth Warren,How many kids must die of gun violence on playgrounds &amp; streets every day with no attention at all before we wake up to what’s happening?

2004,Elizabeth Warren,"After a meeting with the @SenateGOP, it turns out @realDonaldTrump is willing to abandon Dreamers after all."
2005,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump promised to quickly move legislation through Congress to protect Dreamers from deportation. They’re still waiting.
2006,Elizabeth Warren,The @HouseGOP tax plan isn’t about helping the middle class. It’s about shoveling favors to corporate donors.
2007,Elizabeth Warren,The GOP unveiled their tax proposal this morning. Who wins and who loses in their plan? Bernie and I will tell you.
2008,Elizabeth Warren,The Senate should reject @realDonaldTrump’s judicial nominees &amp; stop helping the rich &amp; powerful capture our courts.

2018,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump just doesn't get it: banning people from serving based on gender identity is shameful &amp; it makes America less safe.
2019,Elizabeth Warren,"Once again, a court has put a stop to another extreme &amp; discriminatory policy of this President."
2020,Elizabeth Warren,I'll say it again: the only thing that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether they can handle the job.
2021,Elizabeth Warren,29 days and counting.
2022,Elizabeth Warren,MA has permanent kiosks to drop off unused opioids &amp; also dropoff locations on Saturday. Find one near you:
2023,Elizabeth Warren,Saturday 10/28 is National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. Find a dropoff location to safely dispose unused drugs.
2024,Elizabeth Warren,I fought hard to pass a bipartisan bill that lets doctors &amp; patients partially fill opioid prescriptions. But you can do your part as well.

2029,Elizabeth Warren,It’s clear the Trump admin had 1 goal: to sabotage the ACA. @realDonaldTrump should stop the malicious attacks on US families &amp; do his job.
2030,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump's decision to cancel ACA ads was blatantly political, made with no regard for its impact on taxpayers or families."
2031,Elizabeth Warren,".@PattyMurray &amp; I called for an investigation on the ACA ads. The IG's findings, released yesterday, are disturbing."

2040,Elizabeth Warren,Tonight @VP Pence &amp; the @SenateGOP gave a giant wet kiss to Wall Street. No wonder Americans think the system is rigged against them. It is.
2041,Elizabeth Warren,I’m fighting @VP Pence &amp; the @SenateGOP's gift for the bank lobbyists until the very end. Watch live now:
2042,Elizabeth Warren,"If the @SenateGOP reverse the @CFPB’s rule tonight, they won’t be promoting a conservative agenda. They’re promoting the banks’ agenda."
2043,Elizabeth Warren,"Servicemembers, vets, seniors, and small businesses all support the @CFPB rule. Only people who don’t? Bank lobbyists. Oh, and @Equifax."
2044,Elizabeth Warren,Let’s be clear: No organization that represents actual human beings wants the @SenateGOP to reverse the @CFPB’s arbitration rule.
2045,Elizabeth Warren,"Millions of financial contracts have a clause limiting your right to go to court if you’re cheated, so the @CFPB wrote a rule to stop that."

2060,Elizabeth Warren,It’s long past time for @realDonaldTrump to fight for all Americans – not betray our values &amp; undermine our safety with a Muslim ban.

2064,Elizabeth Warren,"The @CFPB's new rule stops forced arbitration clauses. Surprise, surprise: bank lobbyists hate it. They want Congress to reverse it ASAP."
2065,Elizabeth Warren,.@Equifax &amp; @WellsFargo both used forced arbitration clauses hidden in the fine print to keep millions of people from taking them to court.
2066,Elizabeth Warren,This is a disgrace. Our veterans deserve better. I’ll be demanding answers and accountability from @DeptVetAffairs.
2067,Elizabeth Warren,It’s a simple question: Do we want Iran to have a nuclear weapon or not?
2068,Elizabeth Warren,Wonder why the @GOP tax plan shovels money to billionaires while raising taxes for millions of working families?
2069,Elizabeth Warren,"If @realDonaldTrump won't reverse his birth control decision, Congress should make him. Read my @glamourmag op-ed."
2070,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump's attack on the ACA's birth control mandate not only attacked reproductive rights. It attacked women's economic freedom.
2071,Elizabeth Warren,"Responsible nations stick to their agreements. Responsible Presidents put America's safety first. If this President won't, Congress must."
2072,Elizabeth Warren,Secretary Mattis said it’s good for our national security to stay in the #Irandeal. Chairman Dunford said Iran was complying with the terms.
2073,Elizabeth Warren,"The #Irandeal is keeping Iran’s nuclear program under tough limits &amp; inspections. So far, it’s working to keep Iran away from a nuke."
2074,Elizabeth Warren,The President’s outrageous decision to decertify isolates the US from our allies &amp; increases the risk that Iran gets a nuclear bomb.
2075,Elizabeth Warren,Congress should act to stop @realDonaldTrump from following through on his threat to burn our health insurance system to the ground.
2076,Elizabeth Warren,GOP &amp; Dem governors have urged Congress to keep our promise to families &amp; hold down health insurance premiums. We should listen to them.
2077,Elizabeth Warren,"Cutting off payments that help low-income families afford health insurance is petty, cruel, &amp; just plain dumb."
2078,Elizabeth Warren,Chairman @ChuckGrassley should reject @SenateMajLdr’s dangerous proposal to end blue slips &amp; stand up for fair courts &amp; equal justice.
2079,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenateDems won’t sit silently while the rich &amp; powerful rig our courts &amp; ram through even more radical, right-wing, pro-corporate judges."
2080,Elizabeth Warren,Now @SenateMajLdr wants to end the decades-long tradition of letting senators weigh in on home-state judicial noms.
2081,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenateMajLdr McConnell &amp; the GOP used every tool to stop fair, noncontroversial Obama judicial nominees from serving on federal courts."
2082,Elizabeth Warren,Our federal govt must commit to helping the people of Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands. US citizens deserve that much from their govt.
2083,Elizabeth Warren,"Step up &amp; do your job, @realDonaldTrump. Stop lying about how well things are going in Puerto Rico. Stop trying to avoid responsibility."
2084,Elizabeth Warren,"All along, @realDonaldTrump's response in Puerto Rico has been too little, too late. But he gives himself an ""A+."" Give me a break."
2085,Elizabeth Warren,It is outrageous that @realDonaldTrump is making veiled threats to withdraw relief workers from US citizens in need. That's poor leadership.
2086,Elizabeth Warren,Puerto Rico is still facing a humanitarian crisis. @realDonaldTrump seems more worried about blaming hurricane victims than helping them.

2092,Elizabeth Warren,Access to birth control is about freedom &amp; the ability to plan &amp; build a future. This attack on basic health care is wrong.
2093,Elizabeth Warren,"The year is 2017, not 1917. Millions of Americans use contraception to prevent pregnancy, avoid STIs &amp; manage health conditions."
2094,Elizabeth Warren,Evidently the GOP believe the single most important issue facing our nation is to let employers deny women access to birth control coverage.
2095,Elizabeth Warren,Enough is enough. The credit reporting industry is broken. I want consumers to have control of their own data – not…

2107,Elizabeth Warren,We are worried sick about our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. We must act NOW.

2109,Elizabeth Warren,"Thoughts &amp; prayers are NOT enough. Not when more moms &amp; dads will bury kids this week, &amp; more sons &amp; daughters will grow up without parents."
2110,Elizabeth Warren,I’m heartsick for people in Nevada &amp; across the country who woke up to this news &amp; are worried that their family &amp; friends are ok.
2111,Elizabeth Warren,I’m heartsick for the victims of last night’s massacre in Las Vegas &amp; their loved ones.
2112,Elizabeth Warren,"The definition of ""poor leadership"" is sitting at your golf club while millions of US citizens beg for your help, @realDonaldTrump."
2113,Elizabeth Warren,"Disaster relief workers &amp; volunteers are doing God's work right now. PR needs help, not bullying, from the @POTUS."
2114,Elizabeth Warren,"PR is in CRISIS. US citizens are dying. Millions of people need their govt's help. Stop playing politics with their lives, @realDonaldTrump."
2115,Elizabeth Warren,FEMA's Puerto Rico plans are outdated &amp; are outpaced by charities. Distribution is woefully inadequate &amp; people need basic medical care now.
2116,Elizabeth Warren,I just got off the phone with Mayor @CarmenYulinCruz. I told her to keep up her heroic work &amp; leadership on behalf of Puerto Rico.
2117,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump should use his authority to more quickly &amp; comprehensively respond to Puerto Rico &amp; the USVI. The…

2120,Elizabeth Warren,"Every day, I get more &amp; more calls from people across MA who are desperately worried about the people they love in Puerto Rico."
2121,Elizabeth Warren,"With every day that passes, I’m more outraged that the federal govt isn’t doing more to help our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico &amp; the USVI."
2122,Elizabeth Warren,Puerto Rico was already suffering from an economic crisis long before it got hit by the hurricane. Now it faces another humanitarian crisis.
2123,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump should pick a new @HHSGov Sec who cares less about luxury travel &amp; ripping away health care &amp; more about families' health.
2124,Elizabeth Warren,The Janus case could tilt the playing field further in favor of corporations &amp; make it much harder for workers to stand up for themselves.
2125,Elizabeth Warren,"In deciding to take up the Janus case, the GOP-appointed SCOTUS majority is poised to deal the knock-out blow to public sector unions."
2126,Elizabeth Warren,"When the GOP stole @BarackObama's SCOTUS seat &amp; forced Gorsuch through the Senate, they knew their investment would pay off. Today it has."
2127,Elizabeth Warren,Powerful interests invested vast sums of money into confirming judges who will tilt our courts in favor of billionaires &amp; big businesses.
2128,Elizabeth Warren,#NotOnePenny in tax cuts for the wealthy &amp; giant corporations – especially not on the backs of everyone else. We'll fight this GOP tax plan.
2129,Elizabeth Warren,"And the GOP tax plan will explode the deficit, which will lead the GOP to say we need to gut Medicaid, Medicare, infrastructure &amp; education."
2130,Elizabeth Warren,The GOP plan gets rid of the state/local tax deduction for working families while repealing the estate tax for a handful of rich families.
2131,Elizabeth Warren,"While the GOP plan slashes the income tax rate for the highest earners, it increases the tax rate that applies to many working families."
2132,Elizabeth Warren,The GOP tax plan delivers massive tax cuts to millionaires &amp; giant corporations &amp; kicks working families to the curb.
2133,Elizabeth Warren,"The “new” Republican tax plan is the same warmed-over, trickle-down plan they’ve been pushing for decades."
2134,Elizabeth Warren,The people of Puerto Rico &amp; the USVI need to know their federal government hasn't forgotten them and is doing everything it can to aid them.

2136,Elizabeth Warren,Millions of Americans live on Puerto Rico &amp; the USVI. They'll need huge immediate &amp; long-term aid – far more than they've received so far.

2139,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump isn't following through on his promise to fix NAFTA and boost working families. It's time for Congress to take action.
2140,Elizabeth Warren,I also wrote a bill w/ @SenSherrodBrown &amp; @SenGillibrand to stop states from restricting workers' right to unionize.
2141,Elizabeth Warren,I wrote to the Admin demanding the removal of ISDS from NAFTA. We should look out for families – not corporations.
2142,Elizabeth Warren,Now @realDonaldTrump &amp; his Administration are reportedly proposing NAFTA provisions that do nothing to bring back American jobs.
2143,Elizabeth Warren,The Trump Administration has failed to get rid of ISDS - the corporate courts in NAFTA that give big businesses their own special rights.
2144,Elizabeth Warren,"Despite promising to fix NAFTA's problems, @realDonaldTrump &amp; his Admin have failed to fight for workers through the first 3 rounds."
2145,Elizabeth Warren,The fundamental problem with NAFTA is simple: the agreement doesn't work for American workers.
2146,Elizabeth Warren,The American public deserve answers about what went wrong at @Equifax and what the company plans to do going forward.
2147,Elizabeth Warren,"Former @Equifax CEO Smith, along with the new Chair &amp; interim CEO, should all testify before the Senate Banking Committee."
2148,Elizabeth Warren,It’s also not real accountability if the guy @Equifax promoted to Chair is a board member who served on the data security committee.
2149,Elizabeth Warren,It's not real accountability if the @Equifax Chairman &amp; CEO resigns without giving back a nickel in pay or publicly answering questions.
2150,Elizabeth Warren,I’ve called for @Equifax execs to be held accountable for their role in failing to stop the data breach &amp; hiding it for 40 days.
2151,Elizabeth Warren,Red alert: this vote could happen as soon as tomorrow.

2164,Elizabeth Warren,My thoughts are with the millions of Americans in Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands. I hope electricity and safety are restored quickly.
2165,Elizabeth Warren,"I stand with @SenFranken in saying no: We won’t let Trump &amp; the GOP bypass the process &amp; stack courts with pro-corporate, right-wing judges."
2166,Elizabeth Warren,"Even worse, Trump &amp; the GOP want Dems to blue slip (aka rubber-stamp) their pro-corporate, right-wing nominees to advance. It’s insulting."
2167,Elizabeth Warren,Trump &amp; the @SenateGOP’s latest trick: flout the precedent of consulting home-state senators on nominees to serve on courts in their states.
2168,Elizabeth Warren,But @realDonaldTrump &amp; his GOP allies are using every tool they can to tilt our courts in favor of the wealthy &amp; well-connected.
2169,Elizabeth Warren,The judges who sit on our courts should have one mission: to provide equal justice under law.

2184,Elizabeth Warren,"My thoughts are with the Marseille acid attack victims, reportedly BC students. My office has reached out to BC to help however we can."
2185,Elizabeth Warren,The fight to save heath care isn't over. Sound the alarm. We need you to fight today &amp; every day until this @SenateGOP bill is dead.
2186,Elizabeth Warren,"Let me repeat: The Graham-Cassidy @SenateGOP ""health care"" bill IS Trumpcare, &amp; it will rip health care away from millions of Americans."
2187,Elizabeth Warren,"Coverage ripped away from tens of millions of Americans with Graham-Cassidy – kids with disabilities, grandparents in nursing homes."
2188,Elizabeth Warren,Graham-Cassidy completely eliminates help for families to buy health insurance. Gone. Good luck on your own.
2189,Elizabeth Warren,"The @SenateGOP Graham-Cassidy ""health care"" bill cuts Medicaid funding &amp; rolls back protections for people with pre-existing conditions."
2190,Elizabeth Warren,"There's nothing new &amp; improved about the Graham-Cassidy bill – it's the same cruel @SenateGOP ""health care"" bill, but on steroids."
2191,Elizabeth Warren,The @SenateGOP have a big 9/30 deadline to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And here's the scary thing: they might have the votes to do it.
2192,Elizabeth Warren,"The Boston Harbor Dredging Project will create jobs, improve the passage of goods, &amp; improve Boston's long-term eco…"

2196,Elizabeth Warren,.@AnthemInc's decision is great – but insurers making huge profits off taxpayers shouldn’t need to be shamed into providing coverage.
2197,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, @AnthemInc sheepishly announced that they’re partially reversing their decision to leave VA."
2198,Elizabeth Warren,"Yesterday, I called out @AnthemInc for abandoning people in states because Congress won’t help them to squeeze huge…"
2199,Elizabeth Warren,I’m glad the Senate passed our bipartisan Jobs for Heroes Act yesterday. I hope the House will pass it soon.
2200,Elizabeth Warren,.@JohnCornyn &amp; I wrote a bipartisan bill removing obstacles that delay servicemembers' commercial drivers’ licenses.

2204,Elizabeth Warren,"On top of these bills, I launched an investigation into the @Equifax breach &amp; credit reporting industry in general."
2205,Elizabeth Warren,"Bad credit doesn’t make you a bad employee. Workers should compete on the merits, not on their credit scores."
2206,Elizabeth Warren,Credit reports are already riddled with errors. The @Equifax hack will make it worse. Inaccurate reports shouldn't hurt your job chances.
2207,Elizabeth Warren,I also reintroduced the Equal Employment for All Act to prevent employers from asking job applicants for their cred…
2208,Elizabeth Warren,The idea behind our bill is simple: @Equifax doesn't pay you when they sell your data. You shouldn't have to pay them to stop selling it.
2209,Elizabeth Warren,The FREE Act lets you freeze – and unfreeze – access to your credit file at no cost. It's like a free Do Not Call list for your credit data.
2210,Elizabeth Warren,"Companies like @Equifax make billions selling access to your data without your consent, then charge you if you want to stop them. It's nuts."
2211,Elizabeth Warren,I introduced the Freedom from Equifax Exploitation (FREE) Act with @brianschatz. Our bill gives you more control of…
2212,Elizabeth Warren,Lot of people are outraged about the @Equifax data breach. I am too. Here’s what I’ve been doing about it this week.
2213,Elizabeth Warren,"Today I told an @AnthemInc VP: If they want to make huge profits off taxpayers, they ought to provide decent covera…"
2214,Elizabeth Warren,More than half of @AnthemInc's revenue comes from programs like Medicare &amp; Medicaid. But they're abandoning people in ACA exchanges.
2215,Elizabeth Warren,"Insurance giant @AnthemInc sent Congress a ransom note: bigger tax cuts, or they’d pull out of more state health care exchanges."
2216,Elizabeth Warren,"When the GOP tried to repeal the ACA, some – like @BCBSMA – fought for their customers. But not @AnthemInc."
2217,Elizabeth Warren,Undermining the INF Treaty is grossly irresponsible. Heading to the floor now to discuss my NDAA amendment. Watch:

2223,Elizabeth Warren,.@RandPaul is fighting for an amendment to the annual defense bill that would repeal the AUMF &amp; give Congress six months to replace it.
2224,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s been 16 yrs since Congress passed the existing AUMF after 9/11, but yr after yr, Congress refuses to re-examine this outdated policy."
2225,Elizabeth Warren,Congress owes our troops &amp; their families a full debate to authorize the use of military force before we send them into harm’s way.

2234,Elizabeth Warren,The @CFPB's new rule would stop companies like @Equifax from avoiding legal accountability like this -- as long as @GOP doesn't reverse it.
2235,Elizabeth Warren,That's right: @Equifax fails to protect your data and then they demand you give up legal rights if you want to limit the damage they caused.
2236,Elizabeth Warren,.@Equifax is forcing you to give up your right to join a class action against the company if you want their credit…
2237,Elizabeth Warren,The @Equifax breach is Exhibit A for why we must stop @GOP from reversing the @CFPB's rule protecting your right to join class actions.
2238,Elizabeth Warren,It's also outrageous that @Equifax waited so long to disclose the breach -- needlessly leaving nearly half of America at risk for a month.
2239,Elizabeth Warren,It's outrageous that @Equifax -- a company whose one job is to collect consumer information -- failed to safeguard data for 143M Americans.
2240,Elizabeth Warren,I'm glad community bankers agree: @WellsFargo's Board should be removed. Government must hold big banks accountable.
2241,Elizabeth Warren,Debt-free college for low-income Boston U students leads to a boost in their enrollment! Way to go @BU_Tweets!
2242,Elizabeth Warren,About to speak on the Senate floor about why we must #DefendDACA and pass the Dream Act now. Watch:
2243,Elizabeth Warren,"Thank you, @MassAGO Healey, for fighting for Dreamers in MA &amp; across this country. #DefendDACA"
2244,Elizabeth Warren,The fight over @CFPB’s arbitration rule is about whose side you stand on: big Wall St banks or military families.
2245,Elizabeth Warren,"I agree, President Obama."
2246,Elizabeth Warren,"We cannot sit back while our family, friends &amp; neighbors are driven out of their homes. We must fight to protect Dreamers &amp; #DefendDACA."
2247,Elizabeth Warren,"America should keep its promises. If @realDonaldTrump doesn’t know that, then Congress must act to make DACA permanent. #DefendDACA"
2248,Elizabeth Warren,"Turning our backs on Dreamers makes us weaker, makes us less safe, &amp; betrays our values. #DefendDACA"
2249,Elizabeth Warren,Subjecting Dreamers to mass deportation is part of the bigoted policies that are a cornerstone of @realDonaldTrump’s admin. #DefendDACA
2250,Elizabeth Warren,Very proud of the @MMAAdmissions &amp; their officers for stepping up to help our friends &amp; family in the Gulf Coast.
2251,Elizabeth Warren,Read my office’s new #LaborDay report on how @realDonaldTrump has betrayed America’s working men &amp; women.
2252,Elizabeth Warren,And Trump has proposed huge cuts to @USDOL’s budget – damaging its ability to enforce labor laws &amp; protect/support workers. #LaborDay
2253,Elizabeth Warren,"Trump has delayed/weakened basic worker protections: overtime, beryllium &amp; silica exposure, mine safety, EEOC data, &amp; more. #LaborDay"
2254,Elizabeth Warren,Trump’s nominees for @USDOL &amp; @NLRB have a history of turning their backs on working people. #LaborDay

2260,Elizabeth Warren,.@BetsyDeVosED hired a former DeVry official to be the cop in charge of policing sham colleges at @usedgov.
2261,Elizabeth Warren,Opioid treatment centers like High Point rely on Medicaid. Recent threats put their patients at risk. We need to expand – not cut – funding.
2262,Elizabeth Warren,"Last wk, I visited the High Point Treatment Center in Plymouth, a treatment facility on the front lines of the opio…"
2263,Elizabeth Warren,More than 2000 people died of opioid overdoses in Massachusetts last year. It's an epidemic – and it's heartbreaking. #EndOverdose
2264,Elizabeth Warren,To every DREAMer in this country: You are an American. This country is your home. And we’re fighting for you. #saveDACA
2265,Elizabeth Warren,Ending DACA would tear apart families &amp; rip young people away from the only country they’ve ever known. #saveDACA
2266,Elizabeth Warren,I'm proud of all the men &amp; women in uniform from Massachusetts who are helping with efforts in Houston.
2267,Elizabeth Warren,Congress also can't look the other way. We need the @WellsFargo hearing Dems called for earlier this month.
2268,Elizabeth Warren,The @federalreserve should remove every @wellsfargo Board member who served during this scandal. I don't know what they're waiting for.
2269,Elizabeth Warren,Unbelievable. @WellsFargo's massive fraud is even worse than we thought.
2270,Elizabeth Warren,"Think tanks play a critical role in shaping policy, but their credibility is jeopardized when decisions are based on funder preferences."
2271,Elizabeth Warren,This story is troubling.
2272,Elizabeth Warren,The people of the Gulf Coast desperately need our help. MA will keep doing everything we can to come to their aid.
2273,Elizabeth Warren,And I’m glad that Boston Mayor @Marty_Walsh is sending high-water rescue vehicles &amp; cots to help the people of Houston.
2274,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m also glad that two Coast Guard helicopters, a plane, &amp; crew from Cape Cod are already helping with Hurricane #Harvey rescue efforts."
2275,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m proud &amp; grateful for the FEMA volunteers based in Beverly, MA who are on their way to assist the Gulf Coast."
2276,Elizabeth Warren,"For updates, safety info &amp; ways to help Hurricane #Harvey victims, go to the @RedCross gulf coast website:"
2277,Elizabeth Warren,"When the unthinkable happens, we rely on each other for help. The victims of Hurricane #Harvey – good, hardworking people – need us now."
2278,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m heartsick for Texas. Houston is where I lived after I got married at 19, graduated from college &amp; got my 1st full-time law-teaching job."

2284,Elizabeth Warren,"Today I was in Fall River with @USRepKeating for a tour of Portugalia, an incredible family-owned Portuguese market."
2285,Elizabeth Warren,The President of the United States just defended neo-Nazis and blamed those who condemn their racism and hate. This is sick.
2286,Elizabeth Warren,Let me be clear: These cowardly acts of hate aren't welcome in Boston or anywhere else in this country.
2287,Elizabeth Warren,"We make judgments as humans &amp; as a country about right &amp; wrong. When there's evil, we all need to say it. Especially our President."
2288,Elizabeth Warren,How can @realDonaldTrump can show whose side he's on? He can start by publicly calling this what it is: white supremacy.
2289,Elizabeth Warren,Someone was murdered at a Neo-Nazi rally today. That happened. In America. In 2017. It's time to make clear where we stand – all of us.
2290,Elizabeth Warren,"Racism, bigotry &amp; hate are wrong - in Charlottesville &amp; anywhere else in this country. We should be a better people than that."
2291,Elizabeth Warren,This is great news for thousands of MA homeowners. @MassAGO Healey is one tough cookie!

2307,Elizabeth Warren,"After WWII, a grateful nation helped soldiers get a college education. @realDonaldTrump should sign the #ForeverGIbill to help vets again."
2308,Elizabeth Warren,And our GI Bill legislation restores benefits for veterans who were cheated by predatory for-profit Corinthian Colleges &amp; ITT Tech.
2309,Elizabeth Warren,"Our GI Bill legislation gives better Yellow Ribbon benefits for fallen servicemembers’ families, &amp; increased coverage for some reservists."
2310,Elizabeth Warren,"Our GI Bill legislation includes provisions I fought hard for to help MA vets, including expanded eligibility for Purple Heart recipients."
2311,Elizabeth Warren,I’m very glad to be an original cosponsor of a bipartisan bill to modernize &amp; expand the GI Bill. #ForeverGIbill
2312,Elizabeth Warren,Passing this bipartisan bill is good for every American who can’t afford $5000 for hearing aids. We’re going to help a lot of people.

2315,Elizabeth Warren,The Trump Admin &amp; @SenateGOP socked it to workers one more time before the summer recess: Confirming an anti-worker nominee to @NLRB.
2316,Elizabeth Warren,"Despite all the drama of the Trump Admin, there's one thing they’ve carried out with complete precision: An all-out assault on US workers."
2317,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor to oppose Marvin Kaplan - @realDonaldTrump’s anti-worker nominee to the @NLRB. Watch:
2318,Elizabeth Warren,"Rather than weakening the rules on @WellsFargo, Congress should root out all the fraud at the bank &amp; hold the right people accountable."
2319,Elizabeth Warren,"Yesterday, my @SenateBanking Democratic colleagues &amp; I asked for a hearing with the @WellsFargo CEO &amp; Board Chair.…"
2320,Elizabeth Warren,"Even with @WellsFargo cheating its customers left &amp; right, the @GOP wants to roll back the rules &amp; shield big banks from accountability."
2321,Elizabeth Warren,".@WellsFargo is a mess. On top of its fake accounts, it charged almost 1M people for car insurance they didn't want."
2322,Elizabeth Warren,Congress should pass our student loan servicer bill to ensure @usedgov never heads in the wrong direction again.
2323,Elizabeth Warren,We must keep watching @usedgov to make sure its decisions are good for the millions of struggling federal student loan borrowers.
2324,Elizabeth Warren,Today @usedgov announced it will reverse its single loan servicer plan – &amp; I’m glad that they’re changing course.
2325,Elizabeth Warren,"I worked w/ @RoyBlunt, @SenatorShaheen &amp; @SenatorLankford on a bill to stop @usedgov’s terrible loan servicer plan."
2326,Elizabeth Warren,In June we sent a letter to @BetsyDeVosED with concerns that a single servicer would make an unaccountable monopoly.
2327,Elizabeth Warren,.@usedgov Sec DeVos had a plan to hand over the entire student loan portfolio to just one “Too Big to Fail” company.
2328,Elizabeth Warren,The problem with @realDonaldTrump nominee Randy Quarles? He's never stood up to the big banks in his 30-year career.
2329,Elizabeth Warren,"@realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump nominated Randy Quarles to be @federalreserve Vice Chair for Supervision, a posi…"
2330,Elizabeth Warren,We had a financial crisis when powerful people in government let big banks run wild. @realDonaldTrump wants to take us back down that road.
2331,Elizabeth Warren,"The nightmare is over, at least for now."
2332,Elizabeth Warren,"“Skinny repeal” is reckless, cruel &amp; immoral. If the @SenateGOP pass this bill, they'll show they just don’t care about American families."
2333,Elizabeth Warren,Only in the GOP alternative upside down reality can you hate a bill so much that you’re going to vote for it.
2334,Elizabeth Warren,"Here’s what you learn in “How to be a Senator 101”: If you support a bill, you vote yes. If you don’t, you vote no."
2335,Elizabeth Warren,"Mark my words: If the GOP can’t get a deal in committee that destroys the ACA even more, “skinny repeal” will become the law of the land."
2336,Elizabeth Warren,"If the @SenateGOP wanted a bill they could fix in committee, it could’ve been blank piece of paper. They CHOSE to intro this malicious bill."
2337,Elizabeth Warren,And here’s the worst part: The @SenateGOP knows this bill is appalling. One senator called it “a disaster.” “The dumbest thing in history.”
2338,Elizabeth Warren,CBO says this latest garbage bill will lead to 16 MILLION more uninsured.
2339,Elizabeth Warren,This @SenateGOP bill they’re voting on tonight kills a part of the ACA key to keeping insurance affordable for everyone.
2340,Elizabeth Warren,"From what I can tell, “skinny repeal” just means gutting important parts of the Affordable Care Act."
2341,Elizabeth Warren,"So here’s the deal: In the dead of night tonight, the @SenateGOP will try to pass a “skinny repeal” of health care."
2342,Elizabeth Warren,The @SenateGOP “skinny bill” is here and it’s exactly as wretched as we thought it’d be.
2343,Elizabeth Warren,"""C’mon, @SenateGOP. Pass a terrible 'skinny repeal' of health care &amp; we'll 'fix it' in committee!” ?!?"
2344,Elizabeth Warren,Health care for millions of Americans hangs in the balance and it will all unfold tonight. Here’s what’s happening:
2345,Elizabeth Warren,The American people don’t think that guaranteed health care is a joke. I look forward to the @SenateGOP learning that lesson.
2346,Elizabeth Warren,The @SenateGOP thinks guaranteed health care is all a big joke. They’re using it as a cynical ploy to play political football.
2347,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenSanders is correct: Health care is a right, not a privilege. We have a moral obligation to make sure everyone has access to it."
2348,Elizabeth Warren,"None of this needs to happen, and I hope it doesn’t."
2349,Elizabeth Warren,We won't let the @SenateGOP pass a bill that defunds Planned Parenthood and strips women's access to basic medical…
2350,Elizabeth Warren,"""Skinny repeal"" should be called ""gut it and run."" Voting to destroy insurance markets and kick millions off health…"
2351,Elizabeth Warren,"If the Senate passes ""skinny repeal"" then the @GOP will go into a back room to ""compromise"" between 15M and 23M people losing health care."
2352,Elizabeth Warren,"And ""skinny repeal"" would likely result in at least 15 MILLION people losing health insurance."
2353,Elizabeth Warren,"If the Senate passes ""skinny repeal"" – which guts the marketplace – premiums will skyrocket. Insurers will quit."
2354,Elizabeth Warren,"Senators can hide their final health care bill from the public, but they can't hide from the consequences of their votes."
2355,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenateDems will vote to protect Planned Parenthood – and we will vote down this terrible proposal.
2356,Elizabeth Warren,These next votes are on “repeal and run” of the Affordable Care Act – with a ban on Planned Parenthood funding thrown in for kicks.
2357,Elizabeth Warren,This morning @SenateDems will vote to kill @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s second attempt at ripping health care away from millions of people.
2358,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump can pretend this is a military decision, but it isn't. Banning troops on gender identity is shameful &amp; makes us less safe."
2359,Elizabeth Warren,"By attacking thousands of troops, @realDonaldTrump makes clear that he cares more about extreme ideology than military readiness."
2360,Elizabeth Warren,The only thing – only thing – that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether or not they can handle the job.
2361,Elizabeth Warren,This vote will be the first of many @SenateGOP failures. We're doing everything we can to defend the health care of millions of Americans.
2362,Elizabeth Warren,"In addition to being cruel, this first @SenateGOP proposal violates the Budget Act, so it needs 60 votes. It won't get them."
2363,Elizabeth Warren,Tonight @SenateDems will vote to kill @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s first attempt at ripping health care away from millions.
2364,Elizabeth Warren,I'll be talking with Rachel @Maddow about the @SenateGOP’s immoral health care vote soon. Tune in.
2365,Elizabeth Warren,The power to stop the Republicans’ health care bill isn’t in here. The power is with people like you.
2366,Elizabeth Warren,We're here on the Capitol steps fighting back against this immoral vote to repeal Americans' health care.
2367,Elizabeth Warren,"This is your moment in history, @SenateGOP. You can side with a political party, or the people you represent. Prove we're better than this."

2380,Elizabeth Warren,"The big banks have been against the @CFPB from day one, and their armies of lobbyists are doing all they can to weaken this agency."
2381,Elizabeth Warren,"For 6 years, the @CFPB has had 1 mission: to take tricks &amp; traps out of financial products like credit cards and hold cheaters accountable."
2382,Elizabeth Warren,"Today is a special day. It’s the 6th birthday of the @CFPB – or, as I like to call it, the Little Agency That Could."
2383,Elizabeth Warren,Our report shows: @realDonaldTrump’s team cares more about lining their longtime employers &amp; buddies’ pockets than helping working families.

2388,Elizabeth Warren,"Our hearts are with you, @SenJohnMcCain. Stay strong &amp; keep fighting."
2389,Elizabeth Warren,It’s time for the @SenateGOP to drop this “health care” bill for good – and do it immediately.
2390,Elizabeth Warren,Data nerds at the CBO confirm that the @SenateGOP “health care” bill would knock 32 million off their insurance.
2391,Elizabeth Warren,"The @SenateGOP dug themselves into a hole, &amp; they won’t stop digging. Their ""health care"" bill has gone from bad to worse to embarrassing."
2392,Elizabeth Warren,John Bush’s disrespect for others flatly disqualifies him for the 6th Circuit. Heading to the Senate floor now:
2393,Elizabeth Warren,"Congress needs to step up &amp; pass comprehensive immigration reform. Until then, we must #defendDACA &amp; protect hard-working young immigrants."
2394,Elizabeth Warren,Extreme state AGs have threatened the Trump Admin to end #DACA. Students &amp; young workers who call the US home could be deported. #defendDACA
2395,Elizabeth Warren,"Since 2012, #DACA has protected 800k young people brought to the US as kids from mass deportation. Nearly 22k in MA alone. #defendDACA"

2399,Elizabeth Warren,"People from MA &amp; across the country fought this cruel ""health care"" bill &amp; won. We proved: when we fight back, we can win. THANK YOU."
2400,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump intends to “let Obamacare fail” by sabotaging it from inside. We can't let down our guard now.
2401,Elizabeth Warren,I’m not doing a touchdown dance over health care today. This zombie bill has come back from the dead over &amp; over again.
2402,Elizabeth Warren,It’s abundantly clear: the @SenateGOP don’t have the votes for their tax cut bill – or the votes to repeal the ACA.

2454,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenateMajLdr still intends to vote on this shameful healthcare bill. CEOs have stayed quiet. They must speak up.
2455,Elizabeth Warren,We must keep fighting to save the Affordable Care Act &amp; improve healthcare for American families.
2456,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenateMajLdr says he'll get the votes he needs to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It’s still up to us.
2457,Elizabeth Warren,But let’s be clear: The Republicans’ so-called “healthcare” bill comes back to life more often than the lead zombie in a horror movie.
2458,Elizabeth Warren,"People in MA &amp; across this country spoke out against this terrible ""healthcare"" bill. Today, you proved that you made your voices heard."
2459,Elizabeth Warren,I’m deeply relieved that @SenateMajLdr delayed a vote on the @SenateGOP's bill to rip health care away from 22 million Americans.
2460,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor to tell the @SenateGOP: It's not too late. Throw your “health care” plan in the trash.
2461,Elizabeth Warren,"I just got the latest numbers on the @SenateGOP ""health care"" bill — and there are 22 million reasons we need to fi…"
2462,Elizabeth Warren,This is a tax cut bill paid for by stealing billions from working people &amp; destroying health care for millions. Time to start over.
2463,Elizabeth Warren,"A bill that is opposed by the @AmerMedicalAssn because it will literally harm millions is not a ""health care"" bill."
2464,Elizabeth Warren,"A bill that kicks 22 million people off insurance to deliver $569 billion in tax giveaways to rich people is not a ""health care"" bill."
2465,Elizabeth Warren,Now we know why the @SenateGOP hid their monstrosity of a “health care” bill. 22 million people will lose their health insurance.
2466,Elizabeth Warren,What happens to preemies with complex medical needs in a world where the Senate “health care” bill passes?
2467,Elizabeth Warren,How could @SenateGOP propose cutting Medicaid for this child and the millions like him?
2468,Elizabeth Warren,This loving and hard-working family is what keeps me in this fight. Watch their story:
2469,Elizabeth Warren,What happens to grandma in a world where the Senate “health care” bill passes?
2470,Elizabeth Warren,"Congrats to you and Liz, @sethmoulton! Very happy for you both."

2479,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ll fight this mean, scary, reckless, shameful, heartless @SenateGOP healthcare bill every way I can."
2480,Elizabeth Warren,There’s a reason the @SenateGOP don’t want you to see their mean healthcare bill: they know it will hurt real people.
2481,Elizabeth Warren,Gutting funding for babies’ healthcare or seniors’ nursing homes is mean. Letting insurance companies drop cancer survivors is mean.
2482,Elizabeth Warren,But @realDonaldTrump is right: The GOP healthcare bill IS mean. Cutting healthcare for 23M people to give billionaires a tax break is mean.
2483,Elizabeth Warren,"Of all the words that @realDonaldTrump could pick, Trump called his healthcare plan “mean.” Mean for hard-working Americans."
2484,Elizabeth Warren,There are a lot of words that a President could use to describe their healthcare plan. Effective. Efficient. Comprehensive. Compassionate.
2485,Elizabeth Warren,"If you or someone you love needs Medicaid, we need to you to tell your story. The @SenateGOP need to hear you."

2491,Elizabeth Warren,The @federalreserve has the legal authority to hold the @WellsFargo Board accountable. It just needs the courage to do it.
2492,Elizabeth Warren,Today I called on the @federalreserve to remove all 12 @WellsFargo Board members who served during the scandal.
2493,Elizabeth Warren,5000 low-level @WellsFargo employees got fired. Not 1 Board member did. That's our screwed up corporate accountability system in a nutshell.
2494,Elizabeth Warren,.@WellsFargo’s Board did little while its low-level employees opened millions of fake accounts to meet their impossible sales quotas.

2497,Elizabeth Warren,Giant corporations are squealing for tax cuts – but they're not saying a word about the millions of people about to lose their health care.
2498,Elizabeth Warren,I’m glad @MassAGO Maura Healey has announced that she’ll fight @BetsyDeVosED &amp; this illegal delay in court.
2499,Elizabeth Warren,And Secretary DeVos made it nearly impossible for student cheated by #4profit schools to ever get out from under their massive debt burdens.
2500,Elizabeth Warren,Secretary DeVos made it easier &amp; more profitable for schools to swindle students while keeping their fraud hidden from courts.
2501,Elizabeth Warren,".@usedgov Sec @BetsyDeVosED put bogus #4profit colleges ahead of students, vets &amp; taxpayers by illegally delaying an Obama Admin rule."

2504,Elizabeth Warren,"My thoughts are with @SteveScalise, all those injured, and the brave Capitol Police who protect us every day."
2505,Elizabeth Warren,"As our top law enforcement officer, the AG must be truthful and uphold the law. Sessions cannot continue to serve. He should resign."
2506,Elizabeth Warren,"If AG Sessions were truly recused, he should have had nothing to do with firing Comey. He promised to recuse. He broke that promise."
2507,Elizabeth Warren,"Today before Congress, AG Sessions refused to answer key questions about his discussions with @realDonaldTrump related to Comey’s firing."
2508,Elizabeth Warren,And now there’s talk that the Special Counsel now running the Russia investigation may be next on the chopping block. That’s bananas.
2509,Elizabeth Warren,"But even after recusing himself, Sessions recommended that the President fire FBI Director Comey – who was leading the Russia investigation."
2510,Elizabeth Warren,AG Sessions was forced to recuse himself from the Russia investigation after he lied to Congress about multiple meetings with the Russians.
2511,Elizabeth Warren,The @SenateDems women are speaking out now about the secret GOP plan to repeal ACA by the end of the month. WATCH:
2512,Elizabeth Warren,Jeff Sessions should have never been confirmed as Attorney General – and I’ve called for him to resign. #SessionsHearing

2516,Elizabeth Warren,"Read my @BostonGlobe op-ed about how we fought for a conflict of interest rule for retirement advisers, &amp; won."
2517,Elizabeth Warren,Saving for retirement is hard enough. The last thing families need is to worry if their financial adviser has their best interests in mind.
2518,Elizabeth Warren,"In a matchup between @realDonaldTrump’s #MuslimBan &amp; the Constitution, my money’s on the Constitution every time. The 9th Circuit agrees."
2519,Elizabeth Warren,I LOVE the Boston Pride Parade. It shows our Commonwealth and our country at its best.

2526,Elizabeth Warren,.@HouseDemocrats unanimously opposed the #WrongChoiceAct. Dems will keep fighting for working families while the GOP works for Wall St.
2527,Elizabeth Warren,Financial companies pour money into Washington. Their lobbyists swarm the place. The @HouseGOP’s #WrongChoiceAct is their reward.
2528,Elizabeth Warren,"Veterans, seniors, &amp; consumers all oppose the @HouseGOP’s #WrongChoiceAct. Know who doesn’t? Big banks &amp; payday lenders."
2529,Elizabeth Warren,Let me repeat: The @HouseGOP voted today to make it nearly impossible to hold big banks accountable for cheating you. #WrongChoiceAct
2530,Elizabeth Warren,"While everyone was watching Comey today, the @HouseGOP just voted to gut the rules on Wall Street. #WrongChoiceAct"
2531,Elizabeth Warren,A hostile foreign gov used a dangerous weapon to undermine our democracy. We must set aside politics &amp; make certain it never happens again.
2532,Elizabeth Warren,"No matter who @realDonaldTrump threatens, intimidates, or fires, it’s the job of law enforcement &amp; Congress to get to the bottom of this."
2533,Elizabeth Warren,"Comey’s sworn testimony today paints a picture of a President only interested in protecting himself, his aides, &amp; his friends from the law."
2534,Elizabeth Warren,The first job of the President of the United States – the first job – is to protect this nation from threats.
2535,Elizabeth Warren,"There’s no question this is a powerfully important moment for the Senate, the Trump-Russia investigation, our rule of law, &amp; our democracy."

2552,Elizabeth Warren,It’s @BetsyDeVosED’s job to put students – not predatory colleges and the student loan industry – first.
2553,Elizabeth Warren,The recent Trump-DeVos education budget upends the student loan program &amp; makes it harder to afford college.
2554,Elizabeth Warren,But so far what has @BetsyDeVosED done? She’s hired advisers tied to shady for-profit colleges &amp; made it easier to cheat students.
2555,Elizabeth Warren,"As Education Secretary, @BetsyDeVosED controls the $1T student loan program – a massive responsibility."
2556,Elizabeth Warren,"Selling out to these corporations might be @realDonaldTrump’s style, but we must do better as a nation and tackle climate change head-on."
2557,Elizabeth Warren,"Now, @realDonaldTrump is about to surrender U.S. climate leadership on the world stage by pulling out of the Paris Agreement."
2558,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump and his team have given one handout after another to Big Oil and Big Coal since taking office.
2559,Elizabeth Warren,Let’s honor those who sacrificed for our country by strengthening our promises to servicemembers &amp; their families.

2562,Elizabeth Warren,Lifting the @US_FDA hiring freeze won't matter if @realDonaldTrump's budget slashes FDA funding 30% &amp; cuts jobs. We need an effective FDA.
2563,Elizabeth Warren,Good news: Commissioner Gottlieb announced that @US_FDA will no longer be subject to the hiring freeze.
2564,Elizabeth Warren,I wrote to @US_FDA about the dangerous hiring freeze in January &amp; again last month.
2565,Elizabeth Warren,"The @US_FDA is an important cop on the beat, &amp; I've been worried about the impact of @realDonaldTrump's gov hiring freeze on the agency."

2568,Elizabeth Warren,And @realDonaldTrump’s indefensible budget &amp; unforgivable Trumpcare bill cuts the money needed to fight our country’s opioid crisis.
2569,Elizabeth Warren,The GOP Trumpcare plan is as clear as it is cruel: destroy health care for tens of millions in order to give tax cuts to rich people.
2570,Elizabeth Warren,"We need more investments in NIH, not less. I’ll fight for MA &amp; oppose these misguided cuts for scientific research."
2571,Elizabeth Warren,My new report shows: NIH funding is critical for MA scientists. But @realDonaldTrump wants to cut NIH by $5.7B.…
2572,Elizabeth Warren,MA researchers are curing diseases &amp; developing new tech that is driving our economy &amp; helping millions live healthier lives.
2573,Elizabeth Warren,Our government should work for everyone – not just millionaires &amp; billionaires. We can fight back by rejecting Judge Thapar’s nomination.
2574,Elizabeth Warren,"There are many reasons to oppose Judge Thapar’s nom for the Sixth Circuit, but one should concern everyone: his mon…"
2575,Elizabeth Warren,"Like Judge Gorsuch, Judge Amul Thapar made the list of 21 “acceptable” judges that far-right groups handed to Donald Trump."
2576,Elizabeth Warren,Watch @RepKClark . @usedgov Secretary Betsy DeVos’s answer – or lack of one – is horrifying.
2577,Elizabeth Warren,"This isn’t just about economics, it’s about our values. Health care is a basic human right, &amp; @SenateDems WILL fight back to stop Trumpcare."
2578,Elizabeth Warren,The numbers don’t lie here: this new version of Trumpcare will still bankrupt American families. People will die.
2579,Elizabeth Warren,"Trumpcare is devastating for the poor. Seniors. Pregnant women. People w/ pre-existing conditions, mental health &amp; substance use disorders."

2583,Elizabeth Warren,Trumpcare isn’t a health care plan – it’s a cruel joke. We need to fight back with everything we have to make sure it never becomes reality.
2584,Elizabeth Warren,"Under Trumpcare, 445k MA residents would lose healthcare. We’d lose $10B in state funding. And out-of-pocket costs would skyrocket."
2585,Elizabeth Warren,A new analysis out today shows: Trumpcare will hit Massachusetts like a sledgehammer.

2599,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump has claimed for months that he supports reinstating Glass-Steagall - the law separating commercial &amp; investment banking.
2600,Elizabeth Warren,"As Mueller steps up to enforce the law, Congress must step up too – with its own independent, bipartisan, &amp; transparent investigations."
2601,Elizabeth Warren,"For Mr. Mueller to succeed, he needs total authority to pursue this investigation – completely free of any hint of political interference."
2602,Elizabeth Warren,"It is obvious to the American people that the Russia-Trump investigation requires a special counsel, &amp; I am glad we finally have one."

2605,Elizabeth Warren,AG Sessions didn’t just decide to recuse himself because he’s a nice guy. @TheJusticeDept regulations require it.
2606,Elizabeth Warren,"Sessions played a role in firing FBI Director Comey – a firing @realDonaldTrump said was, in part, based on Comey’s Russia investigation."
2607,Elizabeth Warren,"After getting caught lying about contact with the Russians, Sessions said he’d recused himself from the Trump-Russia investigation."

2612,Elizabeth Warren,Today @SenatorLankford &amp; I reintroduced our #TruthinSettlements Act to shut down the backroom deal making:
2613,Elizabeth Warren,"Settlements may be tax deductible or have credits hidden in fine print. If the gov is going to cut deals, we should know what we’re getting."
2614,Elizabeth Warren,"When the federal gov reaches a settlement with companies that break the law, they tout a big $ amount. But those numbers can be misleading."
2615,Elizabeth Warren,Wishing all my best for a speedy recovery to my dear friend @maziehirono. Your Senate family is here for you every step of the way!

2637,Elizabeth Warren,Honored to speak at the @UMassAmherst graduation ceremony this afternoon! #umass2017
2638,Elizabeth Warren,The GOP spent yrs gutting voting rights &amp; suppressing black &amp; Latino votes. We can’t allow @realDonaldTrump to turn the clocks back more.
2639,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump picked Kris Kobach – architect of some of the most racist &amp; anti-voter state laws – to lead this new conspiracy crusade.
2640,Elizabeth Warren,"Today @realDonaldTrump signed an order launching a ""Vote Fraud Commission,"" but it really should be called a ""Vote Intimidation Commission."""

2645,Elizabeth Warren,I voted against Rod Rosenstein’s nomination to the #2 spot at @TheJusticeDept because he refused to commit to a special prosecutor.
2646,Elizabeth Warren,I spoke to @allinwithchris about why we need an independent prosecutor to investigate Trump's ties to Russia. Watch.
2647,Elizabeth Warren,In just a few minutes I'll be discussing FBI Director Comey with @allinwithchris. Tune in. #inners
2648,Elizabeth Warren,"We need a real, independent prosecutor who @realDonaldTrump can't fire, Sessions can't intimidate, &amp; Congress can't muzzle. We need it now."
2649,Elizabeth Warren,It’s time for Congress to get their heads out of the sand. @realDonaldTrump cannot pick the person to continue this critical investigation.
2650,Elizabeth Warren,But does anyone seriously believe @realDonaldTrump fired the top person investigating his ties to Russia because he was unfair to Hillary?
2651,Elizabeth Warren,There’s no question that Comey made questionable decisions during the election. The FBI shouldn’t comment on ongoing investigations.

2659,Elizabeth Warren,"Disease, sickness, old age touches every family. Tragedy doesn’t ask who you voted for. #AHCA"
2660,Elizabeth Warren,This isn’t football. It’s not about scoring points. #AHCA will devastate Americans’ healthcare. Families will go bankrupt. People will die.
2661,Elizabeth Warren,The only thing that’s changed about Trumpcare is that @HouseGOP made the original plan even more brutal. #AHCA
2662,Elizabeth Warren,This Trumpcare bill still rips funds away from states like Massachusetts that are battling the opioid crisis. #AHCA
2663,Elizabeth Warren,This is the same cruel Trumpcare bill that @HouseGOP tried to pass weeks ago. Still strips coverage from millions &amp; guts Medicaid. #AHCA
2664,Elizabeth Warren,Trumpcare isn’t a health care bill. A bill that destroys health care for millions to shovel cash to the rich isn’t a health care bill. #AHCA
2665,Elizabeth Warren,Aggressive negotiations can yield good results – including $100 million to fight the opioid epidemic.

2668,Elizabeth Warren,Republicans are voting on a bill that would pull the rug out from under state retirement plans. Why? The @USChamber likes the system rigged.
2669,Elizabeth Warren,55 million Americans don’t have access to a workplace retirement account – so states have stepped up to provide these savings accounts.
2670,Elizabeth Warren,.@HouseGOP can keep picking the side of big banks like Wells Fargo over servicemembers &amp; vets – but Dems side with vets &amp; working families.
2671,Elizabeth Warren,Every @FinancialCmte R also voted to take away the authority that the @CFPB used to hold Wells Fargo accountable for the fake accounts scam.
2672,Elizabeth Warren,Preserving the @CFPB’s independent funding is critical – including to the vets &amp; servicemembers it protects.
2673,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, every single Republican on the House @FinancialCmte voted to cut off the @CFPB’s independent funding."
2674,Elizabeth Warren,The @HouseGOP are lining up behind a rotten bill to gut the @CFPB – but @HouseDemocrats are fighting back.
2675,Elizabeth Warren,There is no place for bigotry in the US Army. Dr Mark Green’s comments disqualify him from leadership.
2676,Elizabeth Warren,Our military force's diversity is its greatest strength. The Army Secretary must show genuine support for ALL of our men &amp; women in uniform.

2683,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, @HouseGOP are voting to make it legal for employers to cheat workers out of overtime. It's a disgrace."
2684,Elizabeth Warren,"With working families across the country scraping to make ends meet, Congress should strengthen protections for workers - not gut them."
2685,Elizabeth Warren,That’s the Trump Admin in a nutshell: Rich guys making each other richer &amp; patting themselves on the back. Gross.
2686,Elizabeth Warren,I’ve introduced a bipartisan bill with Sen. Rubio to help cut off human traffickers’ access to the banking system:
2687,Elizabeth Warren,"Human trafficking is an ugly stain on humanity, and we need to use every possible tool to stop it."

2701,Elizabeth Warren,The test of a @USDOL nominee is simple: will you stand up for 150 million US workers? Acosta failed this basic test.
2702,Elizabeth Warren,Real tax reform would close up loopholes for the rich &amp; put working families first.
2703,Elizabeth Warren,"America's biggest corporations have stashed over $2.6 trillion in profits offshore, &amp; @realDonaldTrump wants to give them a tax cut."
2704,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump wants billionaires &amp; giant corporations to pay lower taxes &amp; leave scraps for working families.
2705,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump ran 4 companies through bankruptcy. Now he plans to bankrupt our country.
2706,Elizabeth Warren,"Yesterday, a court blocked @realDonaldTrump’s order. Trump may not like it, but the Constitution applies to him too."
2707,Elizabeth Warren,"Months ago, I wrote to federal agencies explaining why this executive order violates the constitution."
2708,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump’s executive order is immoral, unconstitutional, and dangerous for MA families."
2709,Elizabeth Warren,But @realDonaldTrump issued an executive order to cut off this federal grant money for cities with immigration policies he doesn’t like.

2713,Elizabeth Warren,Shareholders should vote out every member of the @WellsFargo’s board who was around during this scam. This is about accountability.
2714,Elizabeth Warren,Either @WellsFargo’s board failed to fully investigate the fraud for years or they knew about it and did nothing – either is unacceptable.
2715,Elizabeth Warren,Today I released a letter from @WellsFargo’s auditor showing the board knew of improper sales practices for years:
2716,Elizabeth Warren,.@WellsFargo’s shareholders get to decide if they will hold their board accountable for their bank’s fraud or just give them a free pass.
2717,Elizabeth Warren,"For the 1st time since the @CFPB caught @WellsFargo opening millions of fake accounts for customers, the bank’s shareholders meet today."

2736,Elizabeth Warren,"After the @CFPB helped bring to light the fake accounts scandal at @WellsFargo, the bank’s Board launched an internal investigation."
2737,Elizabeth Warren,"If @realDonaldTrump truly wants to help Syrians fleeing murderers, he should drop his effort to ban their children from America immediately."
2738,Elizabeth Warren,"Congress must demand an actual strategy, clear goals, and a plan for achieving them before approving additional military action in Syria."
2739,Elizabeth Warren,The President's erratic approach to Syria is not a strategy. It underscores why our Constitution doesn't let Presidents wage war alone.
2740,Elizabeth Warren,"Within a week, Trump's Admin went from asserting they wouldn't intervene to launching Tomahawk missiles against Assad. That's erratic."
2741,Elizabeth Warren,We need a plan to hold Assad accountable. But so far I’ve seen no compelling strategic justification for Trump's missile strike.
2742,Elizabeth Warren,Glass-Steagall has bipartisan support: from @SenSanders to @realDonaldTrump; both @TheDemocrats &amp; @RNC platforms. Let’s get this done.

2744,Elizabeth Warren,"Glass-Steagall was one of the 1st bills I introduced in the Senate 4 yrs ago with @SenJohnMcCain, @SenatorCantwell &amp; @SenAngusKing."
2745,Elizabeth Warren,"If bankers want to go gamble with complex financial products, ok – but they shouldn’t do it with the money in grandma’s checking account."
2746,Elizabeth Warren,But let’s get real: Most of the big banks are even bigger now than when we declared them “too big to fail” in 2008 &amp; bailed them out.
2747,Elizabeth Warren,We’ve made some real progress since Wall Street’s high-risk bets brought our economy to its knees.
2748,Elizabeth Warren,"If ever we needed a strong, independent Supreme Court with broad public support, it’s now. Rules change or not, we’ll keep fighting for it."
2749,Elizabeth Warren,"The GOP will be responsible for every 5-4 decision that throws working Americans under the bus to favor the powerful, moneyed few."
2750,Elizabeth Warren,The GOP will have to own every 5-4 case that opens the floodgates even more to secret spending in our political system.
2751,Elizabeth Warren,"The GOP will have to own every 5-4 attack on women’s rights, voting rights, LGBT rights, &amp; freedom of speech &amp; religion."
2752,Elizabeth Warren,"Changing the rules to jam through a right-wing, corporate-owned judge means the GOP will have to own the Gorsuch Court."
2753,Elizabeth Warren,"I get that the GOP won’t pick a progressive. But if a SCOTUS nominee isn’t mainstream enough for 60 votes, he/she shouldn’t be confirmed."

2761,Elizabeth Warren,"Title X is a bipartisan program to provide birth control, cancer screenings &amp; HIV tests, &amp; @VP Pence cast the tiebreaking vote attacking it"
2762,Elizabeth Warren,The GOP vote attacking family planning may deadlock. Will Trump really haul in @mike_pence to cast a historic vote against women’s health?
2763,Elizabeth Warren,About to speak on the Senate floor on how GOP will vote soon to make it harder for people save for retirement:

2765,Elizabeth Warren,The @CapitolPolice do heroic work keeping our visitors &amp; staff in DC safe. We thank them today &amp; every day.
2766,Elizabeth Warren,Speaking on the Senate floor about how @realDonaldTrump still threatens to sabotage Americans’ health care. Watch:
2767,Elizabeth Warren,"This is why we fight. When we get out there &amp; fight, we can make a real difference."
2768,Elizabeth Warren,But I'm not doing a touchdown dance today. Not when the GOP is still hell-bent on rigging the system for the rich &amp; powerful.
2769,Elizabeth Warren,Today is a great day for the people of Massachusetts &amp; people across the country who depend on the Affordable Care Act.
2770,Elizabeth Warren,"The truth will come out, @GOP. Get on the right side of history before it's too late."
2771,Elizabeth Warren,"The idea that Devin Nunes will investigate Trump/Russia is a farce. It's time for a real, independent, transparent inquiry."
2772,Elizabeth Warren,The FBI is investigating collusion between @realDonaldTrump's campaign &amp; Russia. When will the GOP end the charade &amp; put country first?
2773,Elizabeth Warren,"Meanwhile, reports today say @realDonaldTrump's campaign manager was paid millions to help Putin influence US politics. Drip. Drip. Drip."
2774,Elizabeth Warren,"After slamming leaks as ""criminal,"" Devin Nunes is now privately briefing @realDonaldTrump - even leaking info to help him."
2775,Elizabeth Warren,Who does House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes think he works for: the American people or @realDonaldTrump?
2776,Elizabeth Warren,The @SenateGOP would undo @FCC rules &amp; let internet service providers sell private info without telling
2777,Elizabeth Warren,"Now the @SenateGOP is obsessed with using the Congressional Review Act to kill every consumer protection rule in sight, like the @FCC rules."
2778,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenMarkey is right: the @FCC protected consumers by adopting #BroadbandPrivacy rules – on how companies collect/use/share/sell our data.
2779,Elizabeth Warren,Massachusetts Sec of State Galvin is right to be worried: @realDonaldTrump's bigotry &amp; hate could greatly influence…
2780,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor now to talk about @realDonaldTrump’s efforts to cut OSHA safety for workers. Watch:
2781,Elizabeth Warren,The FBI Director testified @realDonaldTrump's campaign is under investigation for collusion w/ Russia. Lifetime court appointments can wait.
2782,Elizabeth Warren,But is the Senate really going to pretend there's no cloud over @realDonaldTrump &amp; move on w/ the Gorsuch nomination like things are normal?
2783,Elizabeth Warren,I've strongly opposed the Gorsuch nomination. Giant companies don't need another Supreme Court justice to tilt the law in their favor.
2784,Elizabeth Warren,Neil Gorsuch is up for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court from a President whose campaign is under FBI investigation.
2785,Elizabeth Warren,"Instead of siding with the big banks, the @HouseGOP should join @HouseDemocrats in ensuring that the @CFPB remains a strong cop on the beat."
2786,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, the GOP @FinancialCmte has a hearing about “restructuring” the @CFPB – another way of saying they want to weaken it."
2787,Elizabeth Warren,The @CFPB is widely popular with the American people – and widely hated by the big Wall Street banks it regulates.
2788,Elizabeth Warren,"The @CFPB is a tough watchdog for working families, forcing big banks to return more than $12B to people they cheated."
2789,Elizabeth Warren,"Transparency, pressure &amp; activism work. But we’re going to need a whole lot more of it to make @usedgov work for students."
2790,Elizabeth Warren,The DeVos aide who resigned last week? His dad happened to run the student loan company that sued @usedgov about that pro-borrower policy.
2791,Elizabeth Warren,The damage has already been done. @usedgov announced it would let student loan companies charge some struggling students outrageous fees.
2792,Elizabeth Warren,"The same day I wrote to DeVos about her aides’ obvious conflicts, one of them apparently resigned."
2793,Elizabeth Warren,I asked Betsy DeVos why 2 of her key aides are fmr for-profit college execs with massive conflicts of interest.
2794,Elizabeth Warren,Education Secretary Betsy DeVos apparently thinks her job is to hand @usedgov over to people who want to bilk students.
2795,Elizabeth Warren,Read my @BostonGlobe op-ed about why I oppose Neil Gorsuch’s nomination for the Supreme Court.
2796,Elizabeth Warren,We don’t need another Supreme Court justice to help giant corporations. We need a justice who will uphold equal justice for all.
2797,Elizabeth Warren,Glad to answer as many questions as possible during our office hours at CityStage in Springfield this morning.
2798,Elizabeth Warren,We had terrific office hours in Worcester this afternoon. I’m very glad so many people joined us to ask questions &amp;…
2799,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump, your Muslim ban is now 0 for 2 vs the Constitution. Stop fighting the rule of law and start fighting for all Americans."
2800,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump's illegal Muslim ban is still a recruiting tool for ISIS. Still a betrayal of our values. Still doesn't keep us safe.
2801,Elizabeth Warren,"Turns out, an illegal Muslim ban by another name is still an illegal Muslim ban. So the courts just blocked @realDonaldTrump's second one."
2802,Elizabeth Warren,Now is the time to speak out about the importance of the ACA &amp; Medicaid to your family &amp; stop this cruel #Trumpcare bill in its tracks.
2803,Elizabeth Warren,"Today I told the Senate: If #Trumpcare passes, people will lose access to opioid recovery services. People will die."
2804,Elizabeth Warren,Gutting the ACA with #Trumpcare is like shoving a stick of dynamite in this country’s opioid treatment gap &amp; lighting the fuse.
2805,Elizabeth Warren,Consider what #Trumpcare will do to families &amp; communities struggling with the opioid crisis. We already have an opioid treatment gap.
2806,Elizabeth Warren,There's no other way to say it: #Trumpcare is just part of a GOP plan to help the rich get richer &amp; kick dirt in everyone else's face.
2807,Elizabeth Warren,Who thinks the central problem in America is that middle class families have too much health care &amp; rich people need more gov handouts?
2808,Elizabeth Warren,What kind of health care bill has as its central feature ripping insurance away from tens of millions of American citizens?
2809,Elizabeth Warren,About to speak about the devastating impact that #Trumpcare will have on fighting the opioid crisis in MA. Watch:
2810,Elizabeth Warren,Tune in tonight! #inners
2811,Elizabeth Warren,Throwing 24 million people off their health care to give billionaires a tax break is heartless &amp; irresponsible. We cannot pass #Trumpcare.
2812,Elizabeth Warren,"Alan on the South Shore worries about his daughter Meg, who needs Medicaid for her disability. What about her, @realDonaldTrump? #Trumpcare"
2813,Elizabeth Warren,"Olivia in North Reading has a chronic illness &amp; needs the ACA to stay alive. Will she be in the 24 million, @SenateMajLdr? #Trumpcare"
2814,Elizabeth Warren,"Denise from MA has 3 cancer survivors in her family of 4. Will they be in the 24 million who lose under #Trumpcare, @SpeakerRyan?"
2815,Elizabeth Warren,"MA residents have been writing, calling, emailing me – deeply worried about their health care. And they have every right to be worried."
2816,Elizabeth Warren,The budget experts' numbers are in: the GOP #Trumpcare plan will rip health coverage away from 24 million people.
2817,Elizabeth Warren,I’ll fight back as Republicans try to gut access to mental health &amp; substance use treatment by repealing ACA &amp; cutting Medicare &amp; Medicaid.
2818,Elizabeth Warren,Today I launched a survey of 70+ MA orgs for more info about resources they need to treat substance use disorders:
2819,Elizabeth Warren,"The incredible docs, nurses &amp; staff at Manet &amp; other community health centers are on the frontlines of our country’…"
2820,Elizabeth Warren,This morning I visited Manet Community Health Center in Quincy – a critical health service provider for 15k people/…
2821,Elizabeth Warren,"Newsflash, @realDonaldTrump: The Senate confirms US Attorneys. And you're not replacing real prosecutors with cronies w/out a massive fight."
2822,Elizabeth Warren,"You can't fire the rule of law, @realDonaldTrump. You can't shut down ongoing investigations by career prosecutors."
2823,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump wants people like AG Sessions – a loyalist who lied to the Senate about meeting with the Russians – in @TheJusticeDept.
2824,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump fired acting AG Sally Yates – who refused to defend his #MuslimBan &amp; had warned the WH about Flynn’s contact with Russia.
2825,Elizabeth Warren,GOP &amp; Dems respect Preet Bharara as a fearless prosecutor who stands up to both parties &amp; Wall Street. I guess that's why Trump fired him.
2826,Elizabeth Warren,"Preet Bharara had authority over Trump Tower. @realDonaldTrump called him directly, breaching protocol. 24 hrs later he was asked to resign."
2827,Elizabeth Warren,"Weeks ago, @realDonaldTrump promised to keep Preet Bharara as the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan. Yesterday, Preet was fired. Why?"
2828,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about getting corruption out of gov. But he wants a bunch of tame prosecutors who won’t investigate him.
2829,Elizabeth Warren,It’s time to junk this cruel #Trumpcare bill before massive numbers of Americans are hurt by it.
2830,Elizabeth Warren,A health care bill that destroys care &amp; affordable coverage for millions – seriously? What planet are these guys living on?!
2831,Elizabeth Warren,"Republicans seem intent on plowing ahead anyway – pretending down is up, left is right, &amp; #Trumpcare is somehow not a catastrophe."
2832,Elizabeth Warren,"Don’t forget patient advocates like @ACSCAN &amp; @AARPadvocates – they’re appalled by #Trumpcare, too."
2833,Elizabeth Warren,"The GOP have convinced people who never agree on ANYTHING – docs, hospitals, economists, even insurance companies: #Trumpcare is a disaster."
2834,Elizabeth Warren,Anyone who cares about access to mental health care benefits under the GOP health plan needs to watch…
2835,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor now to talk about GOP efforts to rescind accountability regs of the ESSA edu bill:
2836,Elizabeth Warren,"I promise you this: We won’t stop fighting for women, families, &amp; working people – on #InternationalWomensDay or any other day."
2837,Elizabeth Warren,No day off for us today. Can you imagine what bills the @SenateGOP would try to ram through if 16 @SenateDems women…
2838,Elizabeth Warren,I stand in solidarity with women across the country joining the #InternationalWomensDay #ADayWithoutAWoman strike today.
2839,Elizabeth Warren,@ByronTau
2840,Elizabeth Warren,I’m heading to the Senate floor now to speak out against GOP’s plan to repeal the Fair Pay &amp; Safe Workplaces order:
2841,Elizabeth Warren,"There’s a lot we could be doing to help US workers. Instead, the GOP wants to make it easier for giant gov contractors to hurt workers."
2842,Elizabeth Warren,Today’s debate on the Fair Pay &amp; Safe Workplaces order is about who Congress works for. I’m here to fight for workers – &amp; I’ll be voting no.
2843,Elizabeth Warren,"Instead of helping workers, the GOP will vote today to make it easier for companies that hurt workers to get massive gov contracts."
2844,Elizabeth Warren,My office released a report today that shows 2/3 of the top contractors have been caught breaking labor laws.
2845,Elizabeth Warren,The US gov pays billions to federal contractors – but some of the biggest corporations underpay workers &amp; put their health/safety at risk.
2846,Elizabeth Warren,Read the article @ChuckGrassley &amp; I wrote about our over-the-counter hearing aid bill in @JAMAInternalMed:
2847,Elizabeth Warren,".@ChuckGrassley &amp; I have a bipartisan bill to let some hearing aids be sold over-the-counter, saving families money &amp; reducing regulations."
2848,Elizabeth Warren,Met this morning with the terrific staff of Lynn Community Health Center. Their patients need the ACA for insurance…
2849,Elizabeth Warren,"When we’re #fightingforfamilies loud enough person-to-person, city-to-city, state-to-state, then DC can’t ignore these issues any longer."
2850,Elizabeth Warren,"And while the GOP continues to block #equalpay for equal work, state lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies."
2851,Elizabeth Warren,Businesses that cheat their workers must be held accountable. State lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies with bills to stop wage theft.
2852,Elizabeth Warren,A hard day’s work deserves a fair day’s pay. State lawmakers across the country are #fightingforfamilies with bills to expand overtime.
2853,Elizabeth Warren,And Massachusetts continues to lead the way in #fightingforfamilies with earned sick time &amp; the highest state minimum wage in the country.
2854,Elizabeth Warren,Massachusetts has shown that #fightingforfamilies can start in states. We did it with marriage equality &amp; health care reform.
2855,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump &amp; the GOP leadership aren’t #fightingforfamilies with policies like raising the min wage, overtime pay or fair scheduling."
2856,Elizabeth Warren,And we need Attorney General Jeff Sessions – who should have never been confirmed in the first place – to resign. We need it now.
2857,Elizabeth Warren,"We need a special prosecutor totally independent of the AG. We need a real, bipartisan, transparent Congressional investigation into Russia."
2858,Elizabeth Warren,This is not normal. This is not fake news. This is a very real &amp; serious threat to the national security of the United States.
2859,Elizabeth Warren,Now Jeff Sessions is AG – the final say on the law enforcement investigation into ties between the Trump campaign &amp; Russia? What a farce.
2860,Elizabeth Warren,Jeff Sessions answered “No.” Turns out he met with the Russian Ambassador. Two months before the election.
2861,Elizabeth Warren,"It's a simple q: ""Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election?"""
2862,Elizabeth Warren,I'd like for you to meet my guest to the #Jointsession speech tonight: @UMassD student &amp; Iraqi refugee Tiba Faraj.
2863,Elizabeth Warren,I can name a zillion reasons why MA is the best – but our schools &amp; health care are two very good reasons. Go MA!
2864,Elizabeth Warren,"For any and all these reasons, today I urged my colleagues to vote NO on Wilbur Ross for @CommerceGov."
2865,Elizabeth Warren,"Wilbur Ross has shady ties to Russia, serious business conflicts, &amp; a history of cheating people out of their homes."
2866,Elizabeth Warren,.@CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross is practically a cartoon stereotype of a Wall Street fat cat with no interest in anyone but himself.
2867,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenMarkey &amp; I wrote to 17 agencies about whether they’ll use Trump’s order to cut off funding for MA services.
2868,Elizabeth Warren,MA pays more in taxes than we get back in federal funds. But that money is at risk because of @realDonaldTrump’s order on local immigrants.
2869,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor now to urge my colleagues to reject Wilbur Ross’s nomination for @CommerceGov. Watch:
2870,Elizabeth Warren,Every R who opposes extending debate today is responsible for whatever it turns out is in Pruitt's emails next week. Make the right choice.
2871,Elizabeth Warren,"Considering how obsessed @GOP are with emails, I'd hope they'd vote to extend debate on Pruitt until we can see his secret Big Oil ones."
2872,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenateGOP are jamming through Pruitt at @EPA before his emails come out. At 12:30pm, @SenateDems will force a vote to extend the debate."
2873,Elizabeth Warren,".@EPA nominee Scott Pruitt wouldn't provide his office's records of dealings with Big Oil, so a court ruled he must release them next week."
2874,Elizabeth Warren,I’m speaking on the Senate floor now to strong oppose Scott Pruitt to run the @EPA. Watch:
2875,Elizabeth Warren,"In the choice between corporate polluters &amp; people who want to breathe the air &amp; drink the water, Scott Pruitt sides with the polluters."
2876,Elizabeth Warren,Those emails might show corruption - so of course Republicans are jamming his confirmation through 4 days before the emails become public.
2877,Elizabeth Warren,"A few hours ago, a judge in OK ordered the release of thousands of emails on @EPA nominee Scott Pruitt's relationship with Big Oil."
2878,Elizabeth Warren,This morning I joined 100s of workers who fought their hearts out to stop Andrew Puzder’s @USDOL nomination. Some d…
2879,Elizabeth Warren,My friend &amp; colleague @SenKamalaHarris has a new Senate twitter account! Follow her now to join our fight.
2880,Elizabeth Warren,Glad to meet with presidents &amp; trustees of MA community colleges to discuss ways the fed gov can support our school…
2881,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the floor now to call on Puzder to withdraw &amp; urge my colleagues to vote no on Mulvaney for OMB. Watch:
2882,Elizabeth Warren,"Reports say that Andy Puzder is tired &amp; may withdraw his @USDOL nomination. If he can’t stand the heat, he should get out of the kitchen."
2883,Elizabeth Warren,"And on Monday, I sent Andy Puzder 28 pages of questions about his readiness to protect America’s workers."
2884,Elizabeth Warren,We detailed more stories from Andy Puzder’s mistreated workers in a report two weeks ago:
2885,Elizabeth Warren,We heard the stories of workers mistreated by Andy Puzder’s burger chains at a @SenateDems forum last month:
2886,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump ’s nominee for @USDOL - @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees CEO Andy Puzder – has made his fortune treating workers with total contempt.
2887,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP should stop these reckless actions to hurt the ACA before they hurt even more people who need health coverage.
2888,Elizabeth Warren,"When you shut down ads, fewer people sign up. Now Humana is pulling out of the exchanges. They don’t have enough healthy young ppl enrolled."
2889,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP have worked around the clock to sabotage health care: A vague ACA order. Repeal &amp; run. Pull the enrollment ads.
2890,Elizabeth Warren,"Congress must pull its head out of the sand and launch a real, bipartisan, transparent inquiry into Russia. Our natl security is at stake."
2891,Elizabeth Warren,When did @WhiteHouse know that Flynn lied? What other contacts with Russia occurred during the campaign? Who knew what? Who approved what?
2892,Elizabeth Warren,"This. Is. Not. Normal. @realDonaldTrump owes Americans a full account of his Admin’s dealings with Russia, both before &amp; after the election."
2893,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump is still making money overseas &amp; may have financial ties to Russia. Nobody knows since he STILL won’t release his taxes.
2894,Elizabeth Warren,.@StateDept Sec Rex Tillerson has close ties to Putin. @CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross has close financial ties to Putin buddies.
2895,Elizabeth Warren,Reports say our own intel agencies have corroborated parts of a dossier alleging that Russia has compromising info about @realDonaldTrump.
2896,Elizabeth Warren,This isn’t a game. Reports say the Russians conducted a series of successful cyber-attacks on our elections to help elect @realDonaldTrump.
2897,Elizabeth Warren,But American national security demands that we not allow Michael Flynn to become a scapegoat for this Admin's disturbing ties to Russia.
2898,Elizabeth Warren,Michael Flynn’s blinding religious hatred &amp; shady Russian ties disqualified him as NSA on day one. His removal is a win for American values.
2899,Elizabeth Warren,I will be voting NO on Steve Mnuchin’s confirmation for @USTreasury tonight. I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.
2900,Elizabeth Warren,"If Wall Street threatens to blow up the economy again, does anyone seriously expect Steve Mnuchin to tell his buddies to knock it off?"
2901,Elizabeth Warren,Personnel is policy. Hiring Mnuchin &amp; all these @GoldmanSachs execs shows @realDonaldTrump has no interest in reducing Wall St’s influence.
2902,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about Wall St - but he's hired enough @GoldmanSachs alums to open a new bank branch at the @WhiteHouse.
2903,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump said he’d be tough on Wall Street. That’s a broken promise. #TrumpsBrokenPromises
2904,Elizabeth Warren,"On Friday, the Senate unanimously passed my resolution congratulating the @Patriots on their Super Bowl victory. Go…"
2905,Elizabeth Warren,I sent Andrew Puzder a 28-pg letter (83 q’s) about his readiness for @USDOL to protect America’s workers.…
2906,Elizabeth Warren,Puzder’s company has the most discrimination suits of any major burger chain – the same laws he’d be charged with enforcing at @USDOL.
2907,Elizabeth Warren,.@CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees CEO Andrew Puzder made a fortune squeezing his workers – the same workers he’d be charged with protecting at @USDOL.
2908,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenSchumer’s concerns about Judge Gorsuch should worry everyone who cares about the independence of our courts.
2909,Elizabeth Warren,I’m speaking on the Sen floor now to urge my colleagues to vote NO on Steve Mnuchin's @USTreasury nomination.
2910,Elizabeth Warren,There’s nothing in Steve Mnuchin’s record to suggest he could stand up to Wall Street – or that he’d even want to stand up to Wall Street.
2911,Elizabeth Warren,Consider this MY warning: We won’t be silent. We will speak out. And we WILL persist.
2912,Elizabeth Warren,"And you better believe every Senator who voted to put Jeff Sessions’s radical hatred into @TheJusticeDept will hear from all of us, too."
2913,Elizabeth Warren,"If Jeff Sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism &amp; bigotry into @TheJusticeDept, he'll hear from all of us."
2914,Elizabeth Warren,"If Jeff Sessions turns a blind eye while @realDonaldTrump violates the Constitution or breaks the law, he'll hear from all of us."
2915,Elizabeth Warren,There’s no Rule 19 to silence me from talking about Jeff Sessions anymore. So let me say loudly &amp; clearly: This is just the beginning.
2916,Elizabeth Warren,"Thanks to you, everyone now knows the concerns that Coretta Scott King had about Jeff Sessions. Concerns that millions of people still have."
2917,Elizabeth Warren,Deeply disappointed that the Senate confirmed an AG whose record does not show he will faithfully &amp; fairly enforce the law.
2918,Elizabeth Warren,I’m deeply disappointed that the Senate voted to confirm Jeff Sessions as Attorney General tonight.
2919,Elizabeth Warren,.@AntiochCollege's Coretta Scott King Center is right: Mrs. King’s words about Sessions should be heard. Thank you.
2920,Elizabeth Warren,Thank you @SenSanders for reading Coretta Scott King's letter on the Senate floor. It is powerfully important.
2921,Elizabeth Warren,"THANK YOU to the police, clerks, stenographers, cloakroom staff, pages, &amp; Sen officers who worked all night while @SenateDems #holdthefloor."
2922,Elizabeth Warren,"Still banned from floor, but spoke w/ civil rights leaders this AM to say: Coretta Scott King will not be silenced."
2923,Elizabeth Warren,Thank you @SenSherrodBrown. Coretta Scott King will not be silenced.
2924,Elizabeth Warren,Many thanks to @SenatorTomUdall for reading Coretta Scott King’s letter on the Senate floor.
2925,Elizabeth Warren,Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for bringing Coretta Scott King’s words back to the US Senate.
2926,Elizabeth Warren,Tonight @SenateMajLdr silenced Mrs King's voice on the Sen floor - &amp; millions who are afraid &amp; appalled by what's happening in our country.
2927,Elizabeth Warren,I will not be silent while the Republicans rubber stamp an AG who will never stand up to the @POTUS when he breaks the law.
2928,Elizabeth Warren,I will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory &amp; racist comments that have no place in our justice system.
2929,Elizabeth Warren,I spoke out about @SenatorSessions – until @SenateMajLdr McConnell decided to silence me.
2930,Elizabeth Warren,"On the floor, I read a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing @SenatorSessions's judicial nomination:"
2931,Elizabeth Warren,"Tonight on the Senate floor, I tried to speak about why @SenatorSessions is totally unfit to serve as Attorney General."
2932,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the floor to ask: where are the senators who will say no to @SenatorSessions for AG? Watch:
2933,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenateDems are once again going to #holdthefloor all night – this time to speak out against @SenatorSessions’s nomination for AG.
2934,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump should listen to companies and to consumers and stop financial adviser conflicts costing savers $17 billion a year.
2935,Elizabeth Warren,I asked leading financial firms about @USDOL's rule. They told me: it’s good for families &amp; they’re ready to comply:
2936,Elizabeth Warren,.@POTUS’s executive order threatens to delay the new @USDOL rule requiring retirement advisers to act in their clients’ best interests.
2937,Elizabeth Warren,.@USDOL Secretary nominee &amp; fast food CEO Andy Puzder built a career squeezing workers. Read one employee's story:
2938,Elizabeth Warren,".@paulkrugman is right: there's nothing ""populist"" about @realDonaldTrump's giveaways to financial predators."
2939,Elizabeth Warren,We'll keep fighting until the refugee &amp; #MuslimBan is permanently overturned. #NoBanNoWall
2940,Elizabeth Warren,Relieved that there's a nationwide stay of @realDonaldTrump's illegal &amp; immoral executive order. #NoBanNoWall
2941,Elizabeth Warren,"The Wall St bankers may be popping champagne, but Americans haven't forgotten the 2008 financial crisis – and they won't forget today."
2942,Elizabeth Warren,And @realDonaldTrump issued an order that puts 2 @GoldmanSachs execs in charge of gutting the rules that protect you from financial fraud.
2943,Elizabeth Warren,"After literally standing next to Wall St CEOs, @realDonaldTrump made it easier for investment advisors to cheat you out of your savings."
2944,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about Wall St during his campaign – but as @POTUS, we're finding out whose side he's really on."
2945,Elizabeth Warren,Tonight I urged my Senate colleagues to vote no on this morally bankrupt giveaway to @exxonmobil:
2946,Elizabeth Warren,Rex Tillerson lobbied against the rule for @exxonmobil to disclose payments to foreign govs because it hurt their business with Russia.
2947,Elizabeth Warren,"The same day the Senate confirmed Rex Tillerson, the @HouseGOP passed a resolution to help @exxonmobil secretly funnel money to dictators."
2948,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss how the @GOP is helping @exxonmobil secretly pay off dictators. Watch:
2949,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss why I oppose Judge Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Watch:
2950,Elizabeth Warren,"If you’re going to #draintheswamp, prove it, @SenateGOP. Protecting 2 men who lied during their job applications isn’t the way to start."
2951,Elizabeth Warren,"This isn’t a game, @SenateGOP. The safety of our economy &amp; health of our people could be in the hands of 2 men who lied to the US Senate."
2952,Elizabeth Warren,"This morning, the @SenateGOP unilaterally changed the committee rules to ram through Price &amp; Mnuchin without a single Democrat present."
2953,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenateDems insisted: no vote on these nominees until we bring them back in to explain why they lied. Perfectly reasonable, right?"
2954,Elizabeth Warren,.@HHSGov nom Price lied to the Senate about a sweetheart stock deal. @USTreasury nom Mnuchin lied about his bank’s illegal foreclosures.
2955,Elizabeth Warren,I strongly oppose Rex Tillerson’s nomination for SecState &amp; will vote against his confirmation today. Here’s why.
2956,Elizabeth Warren,"Given what's happening, Rex Tillerson's extensive Russia ties mean we cannot trust him to be a strong advocate for America's interests."
2957,Elizabeth Warren,I wish things were normal. But there is NOTHING NORMAL about this @POTUS and his Administration’s disturbing relationship with Russia.
2958,Elizabeth Warren,"No, @realDonaldTrump, your illegal, unconstitutional, immoral Muslim ban is not about keeping us safe at all."
2959,Elizabeth Warren,"Based on the long and well-established record of Judge Neil Gorsuch, I will oppose his nomination."
2960,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss why I will be voting NO on Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State. Watch:
2961,Elizabeth Warren,It’s time for the Senate to stand up for the Constitution &amp; exert moral leadership. I urge my colleagues: Vote NO on Jeff Sessions for AG.
2962,Elizabeth Warren,Jeff Sessions is so dangerous that a Republican-controlled Senate rejected his nomination to a federal judgeship 30 years ago.
2963,Elizabeth Warren,"Trump expects us to replace the AG w/ Jeff Sessions, whose career is defined by hostility to civil rights, immigrants &amp; the rule of law."
2964,Elizabeth Warren,"Let me repeat: the @POTUS fired the nation’s top law enforcement officer for refusing to defend an illegal, unconstitutional, immoral order."
2965,Elizabeth Warren,"Last night, the acting AG refused to defend @realDonaldTrump’s unlawful &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban, so Trump fired her."
2966,Elizabeth Warren,Watch live now as I speak out from the Senate floor about @realDonaldTrump's Muslim ban: https://t.co/KYG7aJim5s #NoBanNoWall
2967,Elizabeth Warren,I’ll also be sharing the views of nonpartisan experts who are alarmed that this policy will harm our national security. #NoBanNoWall
2968,Elizabeth Warren,I’ll be sharing stories from people in MA terrified about what @realDonaldTrump’s executive action means for their loved ones. #NoBanNoWall
2969,Elizabeth Warren,Tonight @SenateDems will hold the floor as we speak out against @realDonaldTrump’s illegal &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban. #NoBanNoWall
2970,Elizabeth Warren,What a view tonight in front of the Supreme Court as Congressional Dems &amp; hundreds of people gathered to say…
2971,Elizabeth Warren,I urge my colleagues: vote NO on Steve Mnuchin. Don’t put the fates of the families you represent in the hands of a lying Wall St insider.
2972,Elizabeth Warren,Steve Mnuchin won't give us an honest answer about his foreclosure record. He's not going to give us one when we give him our economy.
2973,Elizabeth Warren,"If Steve Mnuchin were the Captain of the Titanic, he’d deny ever hitting the iceberg."
2974,Elizabeth Warren,"You have to wonder, @SenateDems &amp; @SenateGOP: What else is Steve Mnuchin willing to lie about if we hand him the keys to @USTreasury?"
2975,Elizabeth Warren,Mnuchin lied about his bank’s illegal tactics in response to @SenBobCasey's q's. There’s no other way to say it.
2976,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenateDems brought victims of Mnuchin’s bank to DC when @GOPSenFinance refused to hear their stories.
2977,Elizabeth Warren,Steve Mnuchin ran a bank that aggressively &amp; sometimes illegally foreclosed on more than 60k families. That’s not up for debate. It’s fact.
2978,Elizabeth Warren,"I told 20k+ ppl in MA: We'll fight in courts, Congress &amp; across America to stop Trump’s #MuslimBan. #NoBanNoWall"
2979,Elizabeth Warren,"Proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Mayor @marty_walsh, @SenMarkey, @CAIRMass &amp; 20k+ people in Boston today to…"
2980,Elizabeth Warren,We will not allow a Muslim ban in the United States of America. Here's what I said at Logan Airport tonight.…
2981,Elizabeth Warren,Tonight we fight for American values at airports all across this country. I'm at Logan Airport now to say: #nomuslimban #NoBanNoWall
