2265,Kamala Harris,"People marched, protested, fought &amp; died for this right. Let’s use it. Vote. #ElectionDay"
2266,Kamala Harris,I'm investigating whether a big pharma company tried to limit access to treatments for opioid addiction.
2267,Kamala Harris,Thoughts &amp; prayers are not enough in the wake of another mass shooting. It’s within our power to reduce gun violence.

2269,Kamala Harris,"Dígale a su familia, amigos, y comunidad que se inscriban."

2275,Kamala Harris,There are clearly many more questions Jeff Sessions needs to answer. He should come back to the Senate and testify under oath again.
2276,Kamala Harris,Some of the biggest winners from the Republican tax plan: the top 1% and corporations.
2277,Kamala Harris,"En 2017, latinas en los EE.UU. no deberían ganar 54 centavos en promedio por cada dólar que ganan los hombres blancos. Debemos hacer mejor."
2278,Kamala Harris,"Remember when we acknowledged equal pay day for women back in April? Well, today is *finally* equal pay day for Latina women."
2279,Kamala Harris,I’m a proud daughter of the Bay Area but tonight I’m rooting for the @Dodgers to bring that trophy back to the Golden State! #ThisTeam
2280,Kamala Harris,Something we can’t lose sight of: the majority of Puerto Ricans still don't have electricity.
2281,Kamala Harris,I take this issue personally. We have got to stop playing politics with the lives of DREAMers.
2282,Kamala Harris,"Hoy, inscríbase y obtenga cobertura médica:"
2283,Kamala Harris,Today - sign up &amp; get covered:
2284,Kamala Harris,"Happening now: a Senate Intelligence hearing with Facebook, Google &amp; Twitter on the 2016 election. Watch live."
2285,Kamala Harris,Devastated to hear this news out of New York City. We stand with you.
2286,Kamala Harris,Los que han sido afectados por los recientes incendios forestales que necesitan ayuda deben visitar
2287,Kamala Harris,Headed into a Senate hearing on the 2020 Census. It’ll be streamed live on my Facebook.
2288,Kamala Harris,"Happening now: a Senate hearing on the government response to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Watch live →"
2289,Kamala Harris,On my docket today: hearings on Hurricane disaster response &amp; the Census. Both will be live on my Facebook:
2290,Kamala Harris,These kids could lose health insurance if Congress doesn’t act immediately.
2291,Kamala Harris,"Let’s steel ourselves for the fight ahead, let’s not throw up our hands. Let’s roll up our sleeves &amp; get to work."
2292,Kamala Harris,This child has a disability and she is recovering from surgery. She's probably terrified. She needs to be reunited…
2293,Kamala Harris,This is a victory over blatant discrimination.
2294,Kamala Harris,@clairecmc You both are in my thoughts today.
2295,Kamala Harris,El gobierno dio nuestra palabra a los jóvenes de DACA que no compartiremos su información con ICE. Necesitamos cumplir nuestra palabra.
2296,Kamala Harris,National Parks shouldn’t only be open to those who have money. I’ve contacted @Interior to challenge this.
2297,Kamala Harris,"It’s really very simple, if a person can’t pass a background check, they shouldn’t be able to buy a gun."
2298,Kamala Harris,I've drawn a line: I will not vote for an end-of-year spending bill until it's clear DREAMers will be protected.
2299,Kamala Harris,"To DREAMers all across the country: I hear you, I see you, I'm fighting for you."
2300,Kamala Harris,The Republican “tax reform” plan would raise taxes on about 4 million California families next year.
2301,Kamala Harris,Pricing American families out of visiting our PUBLIC National Parks is callous &amp; misguided.
2302,Kamala Harris,“California Moves Closer Toward Ending ‘Unfair and Unjust’ Cash-Bail System”

2306,Kamala Harris,No voy a votar para el proyecto de ley presupuestaria hasta que tengamos claro lo que vamos hacer para proteger a los jóvenes de DACA.
2307,Kamala Harris,Clean water and clean air are not partisan issues. This vote is about siding with the people we represent over big corporations.
2308,Kamala Harris,I still hope that when these nominations come before the full Senate my colleagues will join me in voting no.
2309,Kamala Harris,Bill Wehrum &amp; Michael Dourson have demonstrated they will put the interests of corporations over protecting the public health of Americans.
2310,Kamala Harris,"This morning, the Environmental and Public Works committee voted on two of Trump’s EPA nominees that I have particular concerns about."
2311,Kamala Harris,I will not vote for an end-of-year spending bill until we're clear about what we're going to do to protect &amp; take care of DACA young people.
2312,Kamala Harris,"In just a few minutes, I’ll be live talking about the DREAM Act with my Democratic colleagues. Tune in here →"
2313,Kamala Harris,"Last night, Republicans quietly overturned a rule that lets people have their day in court &amp; hold companies who scammed them accountable."
2314,Kamala Harris,The vote that’s about to happen on the Senate floor is a vote to take away your legal rights against big banks and payday lenders.
2315,Kamala Harris,’55. ’59. ’63. ’65. ’81. ’88. Let’s add ’17 to that list. Let's go @Dodgers!
2316,Kamala Harris,"Hey @TedCruz - when the @Dodgers bring that trophy home to the Golden State, lunch is on you, right?  #WorldSeries2017"
2317,Kamala Harris,"@CFPB So, right now we all need to be putting pressure on Republicans to vote no. Just like we did in the health care fight."
2318,Kamala Harris,"@CFPB That means they only need 51 votes, so Democrats alone can’t stop it."
2319,Kamala Harris,"@CFPB This evening, Republicans are forcing a vote to overturn it, and they’re using something called the Congressional Review Act to do it."
2320,Kamala Harris,Banks and payday lenders hate a new rule from the @CFPB that protects the right of Americans to have their day in court.
2321,Kamala Harris,Republicans are trying to slip something past the American public tonight.
2322,Kamala Harris,I agree with the Chief Justice - the money bail system isn’t safe and it isn’t smart. We can do better.
2323,Kamala Harris,Those impacted by the recent wildfires who are in need of aid should visit
2324,Kamala Harris,This should not be happening in America.
2325,Kamala Harris,On the Senate floor now speaking about the devastation of the California wildfires. Tune in on @CSPAN.

2334,Kamala Harris,@SenFeinstein Thank you!
2335,Kamala Harris,It’s been more than a month and 100% of St. John is without electricity.
2336,Kamala Harris,The Republican budget cuts Medicare &amp; Medicaid &amp; grows the deficit to give tax cuts to the richest Americans.

2342,Kamala Harris,The perfect early birthday surprise in the office today!
2343,Kamala Harris,Here’s why it was so important to pass the Clean Water Act (from someone who was there).
2344,Kamala Harris,We owe Gold Star families the thanks of a grateful nation. Full stop.
2345,Kamala Harris,28% of Puerto Ricans lack running water80% of their electrical grid is outWe need to stay focused on helping them
2346,Kamala Harris,We’re going to keep pushing on this - it can help communities everywhere in the country when disasters strike.
2347,Kamala Harris,“It’s never too late to speak up.”
2348,Kamala Harris,"It's simple - can Sessions point to the policy, in writing, that allows him to not answer questions from Senators today?"
2349,Kamala Harris,"“When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.” - Maya Angelou #WednesdayWisdom"
2350,Kamala Harris,"The American people don’t deserve evasion, they deserve the truth."
2351,Kamala Harris,"Today, if he attempts to evade questions again, he should be pressed on this point."
2352,Kamala Harris,It is unacceptable that the top law enforcement official in the country cannot name the legal basis for evading questions from the Senate.
2353,Kamala Harris,I asked him to name the written legal basis for evading these questions. He could not provide one.
2354,Kamala Harris,I asked these questions back in June when he was under oath before the Senate Intelligence Committee &amp; he refused to answer.
2355,Kamala Harris,"We need clear answers to basic questions on Sessions’ involvement with Russia, and his contact and correspondence with Russian officials."
2356,Kamala Harris,I don’t serve on that committee but here's what I'm looking for in today's proceedings.
2357,Kamala Harris,Attorney General Sessions will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee at 10 AM ET this morning.

2359,Kamala Harris,"Michael Dourson won’t lead the Environmental Protection Agency’s Chemical Safety office, he’ll dismantle it."
2360,Kamala Harris,"Yes. California will fight for the ideals of this country, including freedom of religion."
2361,Kamala Harris,Thank you for your courage.
2362,Kamala Harris,"Frankly, I fear it’s compromising the public’s faith in our institutions and in the strength of our democracy. We can’t let that happen."
2363,Kamala Harris,We’ve seen systematic attempts to undermine the judiciary and we’ve seen the free press attacked again and again.
2364,Kamala Harris,"As a general matter, I’m concerned that this Administration is trying to undermine integral pillars that hold up our democracy."
2365,Kamala Harris,A quick thread about the comments like these.
2366,Kamala Harris,The deadliest mass shooting in our country’s history was 16 days ago. Conversations about gun violence have faded. We can't accept that.
2367,Kamala Harris,Just so we’re perfectly clear on what’s really going on here.
2368,Kamala Harris,We must keep fighting to protect &amp; expand our public lands. Proud to have @RepCarbajal as a partner in this effort.
2369,Kamala Harris,Happy 101st birthday @PPFA! Thanks for all that you do to serve millions of Americans.
2370,Kamala Harris,"As your voice in the Senate, I will demand the aid and relief necessary as quickly as possible."
2371,Kamala Harris,&amp; those who have come from other states &amp; even countries.
2372,Kamala Harris,We all should be very thankful for the California firefighters who have come from all over the state
2373,Kamala Harris,The danger is still very present - fires continue to burn. Everyone should stay alert and heed the directions of safety officials.

2377,Kamala Harris,I've personally confirmed with Acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke that ICE will not be conducting immigration enforce…
2378,Kamala Harris,"If you need to seek shelter from the wildfires, please do so regardless of your immigration status."
2379,Kamala Harris,Defaulting on cost-sharing subsidies will drive up costs for families and will increase the deficit.
2380,Kamala Harris,Deliberately breaking the Affordable Care Act in any way is shameful. The way the Trump Administration is doing it is also stupid.
2381,Kamala Harris,Destabilizing the healthcare markets to score cheap political points isn’t what the American people want or need.
2382,Kamala Harris,People with pre-existing conditions will have to pay more when others are duped into buying “junk” insurance - just…
2383,Kamala Harris,This is another attempt to sabotage the Affordable Care Act and roll back consumer protections.
2384,Kamala Harris,Here’s how you can help victims of the California wildfires →
2385,Kamala Harris,Communities are devastated. Families have lost everything. We need to expedite aid to California.
2386,Kamala Harris,@nwlc We must address these issues. You can read the full report here:
2387,Kamala Harris,"@nwlc And, nearly 1 in 7 girls reported being absent from school because they felt they would be unsafe at school or on their way to school."
2388,Kamala Harris,@nwlc More than 1 in 3 girls of color reported that they’ve been called a racial slur.
2389,Kamala Harris,@nwlc Widening that lens - nearly 1 in 3 reported experiencing either sexual assault or other violence.
2390,Kamala Harris,@nwlc 1 in 5 girls ages 14-18 reported being sexually assaulted. The rate among LGBTQ girls was even higher.
2391,Kamala Harris,"Earlier this year, a report by @NWLC laid out some disturbing facts. These are just a few."
2392,Kamala Harris,Today is #DayoftheGirl and I want to talk about barriers girls are facing to getting an education in our country right now.

2396,Kamala Harris,Dry winds are expected to pick up today in Northern California - please continue to heed evacuation warnings &amp; listen to safety officials.
2397,Kamala Harris,Keep these families in your thoughts today.
2398,Kamala Harris,"This morning I’m thinking of our firefighters &amp; first responders. When everyone else is running away from danger, they run to it. Thank you."
2399,Kamala Harris,It’s 2017 - at this point we should all be able to agree that the ability to breathe clean air is a priority.
2400,Kamala Harris,Thankful to our heroes - the firefighters &amp; first responders who have worked through the night to combat these wildfires.
2401,Kamala Harris,"Heavy-hearted this morning, so many have lost everything."
2402,Kamala Harris,These wildfires in Northern California are some of the worst we've seen in history. Everyone should please heed evacuation warnings.
2403,Kamala Harris,Thank you to the firefighters &amp; first responders who continue to work tirelessly.
2404,Kamala Harris,My thoughts are with those lost in today's wildfires &amp; their families.
2405,Kamala Harris,This decision fails Americans for generations to come.
2406,Kamala Harris,For safety information about the wildfires in Napa and Sonoma please follow @Cal_OES &amp; @CAL_FIRE.
2407,Kamala Harris,To everyone in the areas impacted by the wildfires in Napa and Sonoma - please heed evacuation orders &amp; stay safe.
2408,Kamala Harris,Wholeheartedly agree with my colleagues on this.
2409,Kamala Harris,Joining @CHIRLA &amp; @KRCLA at UC Irvine to rally for the DREAM Act on Wed. at 10:30 AM PT. Join us
2410,Kamala Harris,Covering birth control matters. This is an issue of economic security and justice for women.
2411,Kamala Harris,Now your employer or your insurer can deny you coverage of birth control.
2412,Kamala Harris,More than 55 million women have access to birth control without copayment because of the contraception coverage mandate. Trump reversed it.
2413,Kamala Harris,Reality is much more complicated than the lines politicians draw to score points.
2414,Kamala Harris,"The American people want us to work together in a bipartisan way, the Republicans’ proposed budget doesn’t do that."
2415,Kamala Harris,"Our government should be holding Equifax accountable for financially ruining people, not awarding them contracts!"
2416,Kamala Harris,The Trump Administration has yet to notify DACA recipients directly of today’s renewal deadline. Shame on them.
2417,Kamala Harris,This is not an acceptable answer.
2418,Kamala Harris,"The United States government made a promise to these young people, and we need to keep our promise."
2419,Kamala Harris,"By attempting to sabotage the Affordable Care Act, the Trump Administration is hurting Californians right now."
2420,Kamala Harris,People need to stop playing politics with health care.
2421,Kamala Harris,Americans deserve better than this budget. And I intend to fight hard against it. I’m coming ready with Amendments. (8/8)
2422,Kamala Harris,I have a problem with that. We all should. (7/8)
2423,Kamala Harris,Just one example - it cuts Medicare by $473 billion and Medicaid by $1 trillion. (6/8)
2424,Kamala Harris,"Instead, it reduces taxes for the top 1% and cuts investments that middle class and working families rely on. (5/8)"
2425,Kamala Harris,The Republicans’ budget doesn’t prioritize any of those things. (4/8)
2426,Kamala Harris,"How I see it is, the government has three core functions and responsibilities—public safety, public health, and public education. (3/8)"
2427,Kamala Harris,The federal budget is supposed to be a clear indication of American priorities and values. (2/8)
2428,Kamala Harris,About to head into the Senate Budget Committee to discuss the Republicans’ proposed federal budget. (1/8)
2429,Kamala Harris,"Proudly joining @SenFeinstein to introduce legislation that bans the sale, transfer, importation, or possession of bump stocks."

2434,Kamala Harris,"I believe in a free &amp; open internet, that’s why I support net neutrality rules &amp; why I voted against Ajit"
2435,Kamala Harris,Moments of silence alone will not suffice.
2436,Kamala Harris,"If you need to renew your DACA status, mail your paperwork TODAY, October 3. If you have questions, please call my office (202) 224-3553."
2437,Kamala Harris,We need to pass the DREAM Act - no strings attached.
2438,Kamala Harris,My thoughts on the horrific shooting in Las Vegas.
2439,Kamala Harris,"If you are trying to locate a loved one in Las Vegas, call 1-866-535-5654."
2440,Kamala Harris,Horrified by the Las Vegas shooting. My heart is heavy this morning. Praying for the victims and their families.
2441,Kamala Harris,A great weekend read.
2442,Kamala Harris,"DACA recipients: If your permit expires on or before March 5, submit your renewal application by October 3 so it is received by October 5."
2443,Kamala Harris,"Today, I’m joining the First Congregational Church in Atlanta to commemorate 150 years. Watch the service live."
2444,Kamala Harris,Thankful this family was reunited.
2445,Kamala Harris,The Trump Administration is out there twisting the truth about this tax plan.
2446,Kamala Harris,“Trump Could Save More Than $1 Billion Under His New Tax Plan”
2447,Kamala Harris,Take a moment to read these young women’s stories. Fighting for our DREAMers is so important.
2448,Kamala Harris,See how you can help our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico.
2449,Kamala Harris,"Funding for CHIP, which provides health coverage for 9 million kids, expires in  2 days. We can’t let that happen. Make your voice heard."
2450,Kamala Harris,“Many Trump voters will get zero from Republican tax 'framework'”
2451,Kamala Harris,"""Your fellow Americans in Puerto Rico need help now"""
2452,Kamala Harris,Young people in this country are terrified because of this Administration’s actions on DACA. We need answers.
2453,Kamala Harris,Looking forward to joining the First Congregational Church in commemorating 150 years on
2454,Kamala Harris,Important deadline: we recommend DREAMers mail their applications by October 3 to make sure they are received by the October 5 deadline.
2455,Kamala Harris,We must mobilize all available federal resources to aid in recovery efforts and bring relief to our fellow Americans.
2456,Kamala Harris,A natural disaster in Puerto Rico should be treated no differently than a natural disaster anywhere else in the United States.
2457,Kamala Harris,Our fellow Americans need help. Congress should pass immediate aid for the people of Puerto Rico and USVI.
2458,Kamala Harris,A really important thread. Everyone should read this →
2459,Kamala Harris,This is not a deal. This is a non-starter. Congress must vote on a clean DREAM Act to protect these young people.
2460,Kamala Harris,"There won't be a vote on the Republican ""health care"" bill. This is because of your work. Keep it up."
2461,Kamala Harris,"Los Dreamers son estudiantes universitarios, están sirviendo en el ejército, y son propietarios de pequeñas empresas"
2462,Kamala Harris,"Proud to work with @ColorOfChange, @essie4justice, and Southerners on New Ground to #EndMoneyBail."
2463,Kamala Harris,"This bill would hurt kids, people disabilities, &amp; seniors. We need to do everything in our power to defeat it. #DoNoHarm"
2464,Kamala Harris,The people will keep showing up &amp; speaking out until Republicans leave their health care alone.
2465,Kamala Harris,We should draw inspiration from their courage.
2466,Kamala Harris,Puerto Ricans are our fellow Americans and they are facing a crisis. Please do what you can to help.
2467,Kamala Harris,The Senate could vote on this bill next week. It would be a disaster for California and the country.
2468,Kamala Harris,I will continue fighting to ensure that the Ed. Dept's Office of Civil Rights protects all students &amp; hold @BetsyDeVosED accountable.
2469,Kamala Harris,"Without the Title IX guidance, student safety is jeopardized."
2470,Kamala Harris,Survivors of sexual assault have the right to feel safe and to be heard. This decision is a disgrace.
2471,Kamala Harris,"This health care fight is about the well-being of children, seniors &amp; people with disabilities. This is a moral issue."
2472,Kamala Harris,It’s true - Graham-Cassidy is worse than the bill we beat back over the
2473,Kamala Harris,It was a pleasure meeting you all!
2474,Kamala Harris,"L’Shanah Tovah! Wishing a happy, healthy and sweet new year to all celebrating Rosh Hashanah."
2475,Kamala Harris,Tweet at me if you’re calling Congress to tell them you oppose Graham-Cassidy. I’m gonna share your stories.
2476,Kamala Harris,"Get this - the American Medical Association opposes the Graham-Cassidy “health care” bill because it violates “first, do no harm.”"
2477,Kamala Harris,Devastating. Praying for the people of Mexico City. Abrazos para
2478,Kamala Harris,Couldn’t agree more. Graham-Cassidy is a bill that doesn’t pass any test -&gt;
2479,Kamala Harris,"I know we've been asking a lot of you, but we don't want to look back on these days with any regrets."
2480,Kamala Harris,My thoughts are with Puerto Rico this morning as Hurricane Maria makes landfall.
2481,Kamala Harris,"This health care battle is about fighting for the ideals of our country &amp; when we fight for those ideals, we are patriots."
2482,Kamala Harris,We are fighting for the millions of Americans who have and need access to health care.
2483,Kamala Harris,Great to sit down with the @UnitedFresh delegation today!
2484,Kamala Harris,"I’m asking you to do what you did last time, which is to tell the Republicans to stop."
2485,Kamala Harris,That's right.
2486,Kamala Harris,Rebecca - you &amp; Charlie are why we fight. Thank you so much for coming to see me today.
2487,Kamala Harris,All that means we’ve got to stop this thing.
2488,Kamala Harris,"And, it means defunding Planned Parenthood."
2489,Kamala Harris,"It means gutting Medicaid, which will affect the benefits for millions - people with disabilities, seniors &amp; sick children."
2490,Kamala Harris,"It means that insurance companies can go back to charging seniors an age tax, and charging more to anyone who has a pre-existing condition."
2491,Kamala Harris,"It means that insurance companies can go back to denying emergency room visits, prenatal care &amp; mental health care."
2492,Kamala Harris,It means that states can let insurance companies get out of providing basic health benefits.
2493,Kamala Harris,Here’s what the Graham-Cassidy bill really means for people:
2494,Kamala Harris,One of the greatest injustices in our criminal justice system occurs before someone is even convicted of a crime.
2495,Kamala Harris,This shows that the President is coming for our public lands. I want to make one thing clear: we won’t give them up…
2496,Kamala Harris,"Let’s talk about what the Graham-Cassidy bill (aka Repeal the Affordable Care Act, Take II) really means for people…"
2497,Kamala Harris,An important moment last night →
2498,Kamala Harris,Don’t sleep on the Graham-Cassidy “health care” bill. It will defund Planned Parenthood &amp; cost millions coverage. We need everyone shouting.
2499,Kamala Harris,When will Republicans get that jeopardizing protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions is off the table?
2500,Kamala Harris,This week we need to be focused on defeating the Graham-Cassidy bill. It would end the Affordable Care Act.
2501,Kamala Harris,"The Graham-Cassidy “health care"" bill is just more of the same disastrous policy we’ve seen from Republicans. We must beat this thing."
2502,Kamala Harris,Republicans remain determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We must fight back.
2503,Kamala Harris,Today is National POW/MIA Recognition Day. We remember those who have sacrificed for our freedom &amp; those who have not come home.
2504,Kamala Harris,I believe health care shouldn't be a function of where you live or your income. Health care is a right.
2505,Kamala Harris,Happy #HispanicHeritageMonth! Let’s embrace diversity &amp; celebrate the contributions that make our nation whole.
2506,Kamala Harris,These brave men &amp; women enlisted &amp; the Administration turns its back on them. We must pass Sen. Durbin's &amp; my bill…

2508,Kamala Harris,"Yo apoyo a los más de 220,000 DREAMers en mi estado y a los cientos de miles en todo el país."
2509,Kamala Harris,The other side has to lie just to justify their argument in this fight.
2510,Kamala Harris,"If we're going to be true to Lady Justice, we've got to reform the cash bail system in this country."
2511,Kamala Harris,My message this morning. #DREAMAct
2512,Kamala Harris,"Medicare for All is the proposition that all Americans, from the day of their birth, will have access to health car…"

2521,Kamala Harris,We will never forget.
2522,Kamala Harris,Retweet to share ways to prepare for Hurricane Irma.
2523,Kamala Harris,".@SenWarren, @SenSanders, and I all agree - health care is a right. Retweet if you agree too."

2526,Kamala Harris,Happy Birthday California!
2527,Kamala Harris,"The DACA repeal should make us look in the mirror and ask, “what kind of country are we?” Let’s pass the DREAM Act &amp; prove we're a good one."
2528,Kamala Harris,We MUST pass the DREAM Act. Retweet if you agree.
2529,Kamala Harris,Really pleased to see more support for bail reform. This should be a non partisan issue.
2530,Kamala Harris,The investigation into Russian interference in our election is a fact-finding mission &amp; I’ll always seek the truth.
2531,Kamala Harris,A note to campus and student activists across the country who are settling in back at school:
2532,Kamala Harris,Day made.
2533,Kamala Harris,"This is complicated and we want Dreamers to be as informed as possible. But ultimately, there is one simple solution. Pass the Dream Act."
2534,Kamala Harris,"If your DACA status expires before March 5, 2018, you must apply to renew by October 5, 2017. That gives those DACA recipients only 28 days."
2535,Kamala Harris,"If you travel outside of the United States, you will lose your DACA status."
2536,Kamala Harris,"Applications for DACA recipients to travel abroad and re-enter the US, also known as advance parole, are no longer accepted."

2539,Kamala Harris,I’m a proud cosponsor of the bipartisan DREAM Act. Call your Senators and tell them to support it too: (202) 224-3121.
2540,Kamala Harris,We have got to stop playing politics with these kids #DACA
2541,Kamala Harris,Defending Dreamers is the fight that’s in front of us right here &amp; right now.
2542,Kamala Harris,If you are in an area impacted by a wildfire please heed evacuation orders and local officials. Stay safe!
2543,Kamala Harris,"The fate of more than 800,000 Dreamers rests in Trump's hands. He should stop threatening their futures."
2544,Kamala Harris,It would be a huge moral and economic mistake to end DACA.
2545,Kamala Harris,Thank you to @SantiagoAD53 for your work on this issue.
2546,Kamala Harris,"Proud to hear AJR 10, a joint resolution supporting the Access to Counsel Act, passed the CA Senate unanimously."

2548,Kamala Harris,Health care is a right. RT if you agree.
2549,Kamala Harris,I will co-sponsor @SenSanders' Medicare for All bill. It’s just the right thing to do.
2550,Kamala Harris,Looking forward to stopping by the InTech Center later today to talk workforce training.
2551,Kamala Harris,My heart goes out to the family of Sacramento County Sheriff's Deputy Robert French. Praying for the two other officers who were wounded.

2565,Kamala Harris,I’m as resolved as ever to defend DACA &amp; pass the DREAM Act.
2566,Kamala Harris,"We are all immigrants. If we're true to our values and our history, we will create a path to citizenship for these young people."
2567,Kamala Harris,The president shouldn’t go back on the promise this country made to these young people. It would be truly heartless.
2568,Kamala Harris,Just left a meeting w/ a group of Californians who’ve benefitted from the DACA program. Thanks to everyone who took time to meet with me.
2569,Kamala Harris,"On this day in 1963, Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke of a dream we still fight for today."

2572,Kamala Harris,"To the Latino community, I stand with you."
2573,Kamala Harris,"By pardoning Arpaio, the President has once again sided with division and discrimination. This is a disgrace."
2574,Kamala Harris,Encouraging everyone in Texas to stay safe. Please heed evacuation orders &amp; local officials.
2575,Kamala Harris,We must be on the right side of history by being on the side of these young people.
2576,Kamala Harris,This means that protections for tens of thousands of Native American sacred sites could be eliminated.
2577,Kamala Harris,Public lands belong to the American people. We don’t want them opened up for drilling. Retweet if you agree.
2578,Kamala Harris,Happy Birthday @NatlParkService. You keep getting better with age.

2583,Kamala Harris,Our country’s broken money bail system is tearing families apart. We need to fix it.

2585,Kamala Harris,Let’s get one thing straight: Trump’s border wall is a stupid use of taxpayer money.
2586,Kamala Harris,Joe Arpaio was convicted because he committed a crime. He should not be pardoned.
2587,Kamala Harris,Sam Clovis is an absolutely unacceptable nominee to be chief scientist for the Department of Agriculture.
2588,Kamala Harris,"Following the domestic terror attack in Charlottesville, several colleagues &amp; I are calling for a Senate hearing on violent white supremacy."
2589,Kamala Harris,It makes no sense that there is no path to citizenship for people who were brought to this country as kids. We need to pass the DREAM Act.
2590,Kamala Harris,Unacceptable. People’s lives are not “bargaining chips.”
2591,Kamala Harris,One of California’s greatest strengths is the beauty and diversity of our environment. It needs to be protected.…
2592,Kamala Harris,If you haven’t read about @Common’s Hope &amp; Redemption Prison Tour &amp; tonight’s Imagine Justice concert you should
2593,Kamala Harris,Thinking of our brave sailors on the USS John S. McCain &amp; their loved ones. An extra prayer for those still missing.
2594,Kamala Harris,"My thoughts are with the family of Jared Tucker today, a native of Lafayette, CA, who was in Barcelona celebrating his one year anniversary."
2595,Kamala Harris,The EPA just extended the deadline to comment on its review of the WOTUS rule. Continue to speak out - your voices are making a difference.
2596,Kamala Harris,Scott Pruitt is trying to hide his one goal – to dismantle the EPA’s agenda from the inside.
2597,Kamala Harris,This is wrong. Many of these children are fleeing life or death situations in their homes. We must do better.
2598,Kamala Harris,Thinking of these words from Dr. King today.
2599,Kamala Harris,"The majority of Americans are good, fair &amp; just. Actions in Charlottesville last night are proof of that."
2600,Kamala Harris,Good. The Trump Administration should keep their hands off of all our National Monuments.
2601,Kamala Harris,@SenSanders Making college affordable isn’t a partisan issue - it’s an idea the vast majority of Americans support.
2602,Kamala Harris,"In April, I cosponsored @SenSanders’ College for All Act, to make public universities &amp; community colleges tuition-free for most families."
2603,Kamala Harris,We need to fix a higher education system that makes students take on tens of thousands of dollars of debt to succeed.
2604,Kamala Harris,"As college &amp; university students across this country head back to school, I'm wishing them good luck - but that isn’t enough."
2605,Kamala Harris,A disgrace. My heart goes out to Maria &amp; Eusebio. I will keep fighting for them &amp; all families being targeted by th…
2606,Kamala Harris,I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: there are not “many sides” to this.
2607,Kamala Harris,"If we say this is not who we are, it’s on us to show that."
2608,Kamala Harris,"Our government made a promise to protect more than 800,000 young immigrants. We must keep that promise. #DefendDACA"
2609,Kamala Harris,We all need to stand up &amp; fight for California’s DREAMers.
2610,Kamala Harris,"We aren’t living out the ideals of this country if we aren’t fighting for our community members, our neighbors, our colleagues. #defendDACA"
2611,Kamala Harris,"If we are outraged about what happened this weekend in Charlottesville, we’ve got to care about everyday discrimination as well."
2612,Kamala Harris,"5 years ago today, DACA began changing the lives of over 800,000 DREAMers. The United States is their home. #defendDACA"
2613,Kamala Harris,"We must continue the conversation about how incarcerated women are treated in this country, but this is progress."
2614,Kamala Harris,"For more than 20 million Americans, Social Security is the difference between living in poverty &amp; getting by. We must protect it #SocSec82"
2615,Kamala Harris,But no legislator should be allowed to be horrified on a Saturday and then vote to drag America backward on a Monday.
2616,Kamala Harris,It’s easy to tweet that hate has no place in America.
2617,Kamala Harris,It’s not hard to spot the wrong side here. They’re the ones with the torches and the swastikas.
2618,Kamala Harris,"There are not ""many sides"" to this. My thoughts on Charlottesville. https://t.co/wR8DxyTljG"
2619,Kamala Harris,This hate is against everything America stands for. We must all stand united against it.
2620,Kamala Harris,We don’t want the Trump Administration to open up our country’s marine sanctuaries for offshore drilling. Retweet i…
2621,Kamala Harris,"How about nominating someone else to be the chief scientist instead - like, an actual scientist?"
2622,Kamala Harris,The American people have spoken. Republicans - give up the attacks on the Affordable Care Act.
2623,Kamala Harris,My office will continue to work with this family’s attorney to explore all options to keep this family together.
2624,Kamala Harris,Our scientific community has spoken on climate change. I want them to know with certainty that I hear them.
2625,Kamala Harris,"Climate change is a reality. We need to create policy to protect our planet, eyes wide open."
2626,Kamala Harris,"It’s here in black &amp; white, the actions of the Trump administration are causing premiums to rise for some families."
2627,Kamala Harris,Americans oppose Trump’s ban on transgender service members and rightfully so.
2628,Kamala Harris,"Right now, there are women in prison facilities being denied access to hygiene &amp; reproductive health. That’s wrong."
2629,Kamala Harris,"On the issue of incarcerated women, we need to be smarter."
2630,Kamala Harris,We need to be treating the opioid epidemic in a way that’s smart &amp; effective. Reigniting the failed “War on Drugs” is neither of those.
2631,Kamala Harris,We must work to de-escalate tensions with North Korea. Countering this serious threat requires steady-handed leadership &amp; diplomacy.
2632,Kamala Harris,"We must work until every child is treated equally. Nikki - keep fighting, we’re with you. #TransRightsAreHumanRights"
2633,Kamala Harris,This is unacceptable. Several of my colleagues &amp; I have already contacted CMS Administrator Seema Verma.
2634,Kamala Harris,"Because of the Trump Administration, seniors who have faced abuse may never see their day in court."
2635,Kamala Harris,Seniors on fixed incomes shouldn’t be forced to choose between their rights and their care when looking for a nursing home.
2636,Kamala Harris,&amp; they allow the nursing home operator to keep the legal challenge out of the court system.
2637,Kamala Harris,Now what’s forced arbitration? They are fine-print clauses that force seniors to give up their rights without their actual consent
2638,Kamala Harris,"If a nursing home accepts taxpayer dollars through Medicaid &amp; Medicare, it shouldn’t be able to use forced arbitration. Plain &amp; simple."
2639,Kamala Harris,There’s just one week left in the public comment period for marine sanctuaries. Please make your voice heard.
2640,Kamala Harris,@SenGillibrand @SenSanders These rules are under attack by this Administration every day.

2642,Kamala Harris,"@SenGillibrand @SenSanders And yes, we can and should be doing more to address economic injustices that exist at th…"
2643,Kamala Harris,We should pass @SenGillibrand’s national paid family leave bill &amp; @SenSanders’ College for All Act.
2644,Kamala Harris,Let’s be clear - there are concrete ways we can begin to address it. We should start by raising the federal minimum wage $15 an hour.
2645,Kamala Harris,We need to fix the gross inequality in income growth that exists in this country.
2646,Kamala Harris,"I’ve met this man’s remarkable daughters. Some good news in his case, but this family still needs to be reunited."
2647,Kamala Harris,“Americans shouldn’t tolerate keeping people in jail simply because they are poor.”
2648,Kamala Harris,Public comments are now being accepted through August 15. Please make your voice heard on this issue.
2649,Kamala Harris,"They encompass millions of acres of coral reefs, pristine beaches, and habitats for whales and other marine life."
2650,Kamala Harris,These sanctuaries are essential to the recreation and tourism that drive our coastal economies.
2651,Kamala Harris,"Something you're not hearing in the news – this Administration is ""reviewing"" whether to shrink/eliminate some of our marine sanctuaries."
2652,Kamala Harris,"On #PurpleHeartDay &amp; every day, we honor the sacrifices made by those who serve our country. To our brave men &amp; women in uniform: thank you."
2653,Kamala Harris,"In 2017, 99 bills were introduced in 31 states to restrict access to voting. Let’s be clear - this fight is not yet over."
2654,Kamala Harris,Trump's election commission has reinforced that the fundamental right to vote remains under attack today.
2655,Kamala Harris,"Today, there are still too many ways in which people are discouraged from voting &amp; parts of the Voting Rights Act have since been weakened."
2656,Kamala Harris,"On the Voting Rights Act's anniversary, we’re reminded of those who marched &amp; protested, who were beaten &amp; arrested – for the right to vote."
2657,Kamala Harris,ICYMI – earlier this week on #BlackWomensEqualPay day I shared my thoughts on ending the pay gap for black women.
2658,Kamala Harris,Proof that you don’t need a big title to make a big difference.
2659,Kamala Harris,.@Maziehirono is a force.
2660,Kamala Harris,“End money bail to transform the lives of women and families across the nation”
2661,Kamala Harris,"A few days behind bars can cost people their job, home, custody of their kids, or their life. We need #BailReform."
2662,Kamala Harris,"We must pass the FAMILY Act, a bill spearheaded by my friend @SenGillibrand, which establishes national paid family leave."
2663,Kamala Harris,"Right now, only 14% of working people have paid family leave through their employers. We need to fix that."
2664,Kamala Harris,"No one should have to choose between taking care of a sick parent, spouse or child and losing their job."
2665,Kamala Harris,It sure doesn’t.
2666,Kamala Harris,"I believe, even in an environment that sometimes seems hyper-political, there are opportunities to get things done."
2667,Kamala Harris,@amyklobuchar This is an example of a fix to our health care system both parties should agree on.
2668,Kamala Harris,I’ve signed on to a bill sponsored by @AmyKlobuchar that's aimed to lower prescription drug costs for seniors.
2669,Kamala Harris,"Immigrants don’t just belong in America, immigrants have built America. I oppose the RAISE Act."
2670,Kamala Harris,We can’t allow corporations to profit on the backs of workers who are being grossly mistreated.
2671,Kamala Harris,"Thinking of these words from James Baldwin on his birthday, “Nothing can be changed until it is faced.” #WednesdayWisdom"
2672,Kamala Harris,"SCOTUS said “Student body diversity promotes learning outcomes, &amp; better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce &amp; society.”"
2673,Kamala Harris,Campus diversity helps disrupt the cycle of resegregation. It promotes understanding &amp; breaks down racial stereotypes.
2674,Kamala Harris,"Make no mistake, diversity in education makes everyone smarter. It’s a strength not a weakness."
2675,Kamala Harris,Jeff Sessions’ attack on #AffirmativeAction is yet another attempt by this Administration to roll back progress &amp; divide us.
2676,Kamala Harris,Looking forward to welcoming the world to my home state of California!
2677,Kamala Harris,My request of you today is this: join me in standing up and speaking out for fair pay for Black women (via @Bustle).
2678,Kamala Harris,"Whether someone is detained before trial should be determined by whether they're a risk to their community, not whe…"
2679,Kamala Harris,A worthy bipartisan cause indeed. Wouldn’t you agree @RandPaul?
2680,Kamala Harris,"Let’s get more Black women working in STEM, raise the minimum wage &amp; advocate for pay transparency. #BlackWomensEqualPay"
2681,Kamala Harris,We must address the disproportionate number of Black women who are stuck in low-paying jobs. #BlackWomensEqualPay
2682,Kamala Harris,This is about families – eight out of every ten Black mothers are their family’s breadwinner. They deserve fair pay. #BlackWomensEqualPay
2683,Kamala Harris,"Every American in this country deserves pay equity, not 63 cents to the dollar. #BlackWomensEqualPay"
2684,Kamala Harris,"On average, Black women in this country make only 63 cents relative to every dollar white men are paid. #BlackWomensEqualPay"
2685,Kamala Harris,We need to do more to address the economic injustice that exists at the intersection of gender &amp; race. #BlackWomensEqualPay
2686,Kamala Harris,The pay gap for Black women adds up to a devastating economic disadvantage. It’s time we address it.
2687,Kamala Harris,"“Bail reform goes big with smart bill from senators Kamala Harris, Rand Paul”"

2690,Kamala Harris,"If @EPAScottPruitt won’t stand up for the health of our children &amp; ban chlorpyrifos, we will."
2691,Kamala Harris,You may stay in jail even if you didn't commit a crime - just because you can't make bail. We need to fix that.
2692,Kamala Harris,I will closely scrutinize the next nominee to run this critical department.
2693,Kamala Harris,"I've had serious concerns about Sec. Kelly and DHS' immigration policies that are detrimental to families, public safety and our economy."

2695,Kamala Harris,Last night was quite a night.
2696,Kamala Harris,ICYMI – I joined @CapehartJ to discuss criminal justice reform and Russia. Listen here:
2697,Kamala Harris,You did this.
2698,Kamala Harris,It's because Americans told their stories and made their voices heard.
2699,Kamala Harris,"It's because people all across this country wrote letters, made phone calls, and showed up at rallies &amp; town halls."
2700,Kamala Harris,"Tonight, cancer patients and those with preexisting conditions are more secure."
2701,Kamala Harris,Seniors in nursing homes and children with complex medical conditions are more secure.
2702,Kamala Harris,"Tonight, veterans and working families who rely on Medicaid are more secure."
2703,Kamala Harris,"Tonight, the message sent by the American people was vindicated: Republicans must no longer play politics with people’s lives."
2704,Kamala Harris,On behalf of the people of California - who I have the privilege to represent - I vote no.
2705,Kamala Harris,It’s going to be a late night in the Senate. Stay with me for updates on the health care vote tonight.
2706,Kamala Harris,The so-called “skinny repeal” isn’t a fix at all. 16 million more people uninsured &amp; a 20% spike in premiums. It’s terrible.
2707,Kamala Harris,It's absurd we still don’t know what's in this bill. Republicans need to make it public. Nearly every family in this country is impacted.
2708,Kamala Harris,This is wrong. Discriminating against someone based on who they love is discrimination. Full
2709,Kamala Harris,"Let’s keep calling, let’s keep tweeting, let’s keep writing, let’s keep marching, let’s keep shouting. Let’s win."
2710,Kamala Harris,I’m asking you this – keep doing you. Keep doing what you’ve been doing because it’s working. It matters. It counts.
2711,Kamala Harris,We’ve got about 36 more hours in this health care fight. We don’t want to look back on these 36 hours with any regrets.

2726,Kamala Harris,"Taking a quick break from tweeting about health care to say yes, I fully agree."
2727,Kamala Harris,Republicans need to stop playing politics with our health care.
2728,Kamala Harris,It’s ridiculous that I have to say this. Knowing what we’re voting on should be a requirement.
2729,Kamala Harris,"We still don’t know what ""health care"" bill Republicans want us to vote on today."

2745,Kamala Harris,Whether a defendant is detained before trial should be determined by whether they’re a risk – not whether they’re rich. We need bail reform.
2746,Kamala Harris,"Today, @RandPaul &amp; I introduced “The Pretrial Integrity and Safety Act of 2017."""
2747,Kamala Harris,"We desperately need #BailReform. Our bail system is discriminatory, wasteful, and fails the public safety test."

2752,Kamala Harris,Ending DACA would be cruel and senseless - these young Dreamers contribute to our country and our state. #DefendDACA
2753,Kamala Harris,The pressure Republican Senators feel from the people they represent needs to be stronger than the pressure they get from the White House.
2754,Kamala Harris,Please don’t rest on health care. This fight is not yet won. We must continue to make our voices heard – loud &amp; clear.
2755,Kamala Harris,Ripping health insurance away from 32 million people in no way improves our health care system. It’s cruel.
2756,Kamala Harris,"If the Republicans get their way with this repeal, premiums on the individual market will be 50% higher next year and could double by 2026."
2757,Kamala Harris,"Under the Republicans' plan to repeal Obamacare, an estimated 32 million more Americans will be uninsured."
2758,Kamala Harris,Repeal and delay is the worst idea we’ve seen from the GOP yet. More people will be uninsured under this plan than any of their others.
2759,Kamala Harris,"Today, I want to talk a little about what the latest plan, to “repeal and delay,” Obamacare means."
2760,Kamala Harris,"This afternoon, Republican Senators will meet at the White House in an attempt to twist their arms &amp; get them to vote to repeal the ACA."
2761,Kamala Harris,I strongly oppose John Bush's nomination.
2762,Kamala Harris,A qualified judicial nominee must uphold justice for all &amp; consider the impact of their decisions on our society.
2763,Kamala Harris,He opposes the rights of women and LGBTQ Americans and perpetuates discriminatory conspiracy theories.
2764,Kamala Harris,"John Bush, nominated by Republicans to serve a lifetime appointment on the Sixth Circuit, checks essentially every box for an unfit nominee."

2778,Kamala Harris,"Evan told me he’s going to be president someday. Between now and then, I’m going to do all I can to fight for him &amp; defeat this bad bill."
2779,Kamala Harris,He relies on Medicaid for his health care - the same program Republicans proposed massive cuts to today in their “new health care” bill.
2780,Kamala Harris,"Evan was diagnosed in utero with renal failure and multiple congenital anomalies, and he was also born premature."
2781,Kamala Harris,"Today, I met a remarkable boy named Evan and I want you to meet him too."
2782,Kamala Harris,The new Republican health care bill still guts Medicaid and allows insurers to sell terrible plans.
2783,Kamala Harris,"As the GOP tries to twist arms to pass this disastrous bill, we must remain focused on defeating it."
2784,Kamala Harris,And that’s sugarcoating it.
2785,Kamala Harris,"The ""new"" Republican health care bill is still a disaster."
2786,Kamala Harris,Such wonderful news. Thrilled we'll have an Olympic Games in the City of

2789,Kamala Harris,I agree - Betsy DeVos should be protecting students not predatory for-profit colleges. Retweet if you do too.
2790,Kamala Harris,This is what the internet could look like without #NetNeutrality.
2791,Kamala Harris,"Proud to join @CoryBooker, @SenWarren, &amp; @SenatorDurbin to work to reform the way women are treated behind bars."
2792,Kamala Harris,The genius of the internet is that it enables entrepreneurship on a level playing field. Rolling back #NetNeutrality threatens that.
2793,Kamala Harris,A new rule from the @CFPB lets cheated families have their day in court &amp; hold banks accountable. The GOP is already working to overturn it.
2794,Kamala Harris,"I agree with my intel colleagues - Donald Trump Jr, Kushner and Manafort should come before the Senate Intel Committee. We need answers."
2795,Kamala Harris,"Let's be clear - if a foreign adversary contacts a campaign with damaging information about an opponent, first call should be to the FBI."
2796,Kamala Harris,This is wrong. No one should be discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition. RT if you agree.
2797,Kamala Harris,"Republicans are doing this to try to pass their disastrous ""health care"" bill. Keep making your voices heard."
2798,Kamala Harris,Saddened by the loss of 16 brave Marines in Mississippi. Praying for their families and all our servicemen &amp; women &amp; their families.
2799,Kamala Harris,The Republican “health care” plan isn’t even a health care plan. It could harm 22 million people in favor of the 0.4%. It’s indefensible.

2855,Kamala Harris,"All the while, the Republican health care bill gives insurance companies &amp; the top 1% tax breaks."
2856,Kamala Harris,The Republican health care bill causes millions of Americans with insurance coverage through their employer to lose coverage.
2857,Kamala Harris,"This bill cuts $772 billion from Medicaid programs that, among other things, help seniors pay for nursing home care."
2858,Kamala Harris,The Republican health care bill will make premiums to go up an average of 20 percent next year and will cause coverage to be worse.
2859,Kamala Harris,22 million more Americans would be uninsured over the next decade including 15 million Americans next year under the bill.
2860,Kamala Harris,The Congressional Budget Office has just released their score on this terrible health care bill. Here’s what it told us:

2872,Kamala Harris,"We need to stand up for students, not make it easier for them to be scammed by for-profit colleges."
2873,Kamala Harris,Let’s call the Republican “health care” bill what it is: the “Tax Cuts for Millionaires Act.”
2874,Kamala Harris,Thankful for the legacy of Patsy Mink – the first woman of color elected to Congress and the mother of Title IX.
2875,Kamala Harris,Defending Title IX is about defending civil rights.
2876,Kamala Harris,Throwing millions of working people off their health insurance to give tax breaks to the top 1% is considered a victory to some.
2877,Kamala Harris,What “cutting Medicaid” really means: less resources for kids with disabilities in schools &amp; less support for many seniors in nursing homes.
2878,Kamala Harris,"Regardless of party, we must vote down this ""health care"" bill and stand up for the people we represent and serve."
2879,Kamala Harris,Ellen - I promise to fight for your family.
2880,Kamala Harris,Blocking millions from getting preventive care at Planned Parenthood is wrong. Women in this country will not be silenced on this issue.

2884,Kamala Harris,Read the Republican plan to give tax cuts to millionaires while cutting support for kids with disabilities:
2885,Kamala Harris,This is black and white. The Republican “health care” bill cuts health care for people in need to give taxes cuts to millionaires.
2886,Kamala Harris,The real reason the Republican health care bill is a secret: they want to cover fewer people &amp; give tax cuts to the wealthy.

2935,Kamala Harris,"Since it came to light Sessions misled during his testimony in front of the Senate, I have called on him to resign."
2936,Kamala Harris,Bob Mueller deserves full independence. Full stop.
2937,Kamala Harris,Did Sessions violate the terms of his recusal from the Russia investigation by being involved in the firing of James Comey?
2938,Kamala Harris,My focus today will be on gathering the facts and information surrounding a few questions. Among them:

2959,Kamala Harris,A key part of my line of questioning for former FBI Director James Comey today: the involvement of Attorney General…
2960,Kamala Harris,"Today, former FBI Director Comey affirmed under oath that Mueller should have full independence. I agree, we owe it to the American people."
2961,Kamala Harris,"I didn’t receive a sufficient yes or no answer to my question, but I will keep pushing for that answer."
2962,Kamala Harris,"Yesterday, I pushed Rosenstein to commit in writing that Mueller has full independence - otherwise the same thing may well happen to Mueller"
2963,Kamala Harris,Rosenstein now oversees the special investigation run by Mueller – which is something we should be concerned about.
2964,Kamala Harris,"Key point: Comey told Rosenstein about his concerns about Trump meetings. Then, Rosenstein still wrote the memo justifying his firing."
2965,Kamala Harris,Comey said he documented his conversation with Trump because he was concerned Trump would lie about their meetings. This is stunning.
2966,Kamala Harris,"Unequivocally, the Russians interfered in our election and they will be back to interfere again."
