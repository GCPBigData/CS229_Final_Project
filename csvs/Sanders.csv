0,Sanders,"Drug companies charge the American people whatever price they want, and they can because our system, and only ours, allows it.It will not be an easy fight‚Äîno great struggle for justice is‚Äîbut working together, we will end the outrageous greed of Big Pharma."
1,Sanders,End this war.
2,Sanders,"On #CyberMonday, shoppers will rely on the U.S. Postal Service for fast, reliable, and affordable shipping. But Mr. Trump wants to privatize and destroy it.These good-paying unionized jobs lifted families like @MrDannyGlover's into the middle class‚Äîwe must protect them."
3,Sanders,We are taking on the big-money interests who have an army of lobbyists trying to defeat Medicare for All. They are terrified that the American people recognize that health care is a human right. They're right to be terrified.
4,Sanders,"More than a decade ago, advocates for working people warned that the WTO and unfettered free trade agreements would lead to the loss of millions of good-paying American jobs. Guess what? We were right."
5,Sanders,"This is called oligarchy: government of, by, and for the billionaire class."
6,Sanders,Our world is beautiful and fragile. We must put our energies into building the political power we need to solve the problem of climate change before it is too late.
7,Sanders,Trump and his friends weren't satisfied with giving away trillions of dollars to the rich‚Äînow they're trying to take food out of the mouths of a million needy schoolchildren across America.We have got to stand together and defeat their disgusting agenda.
8,Sanders,Nearly half our college students are going hungry. The top 25 hedge-fund managers on average get $850 million a year‚Äîeach.Wall Street‚Äôs greed wrecked the hopes and futures of an entire generation. So we will tax Wall Street to cancel all student debt and offer college for all.
9,Sanders,"U.S. corporations see a future in countries that pay workers pennies an hour. But when they need a bailout, they don't ask China or Vietnam for help‚Äîthey get their welfare check from the taxpayers of America. Maybe U.S. corporations should invest and pay taxes in America, too."
10,Sanders,"I stand in solidarity with Amazon warehouse workers demanding to be treated like human beings. They are sick and tired of the brutal working conditions, injuries, surveillance, and workplace deaths‚Äîall to fatten the pockets of a billion-dollar corporation."
11,Sanders,"""Tax me!"" Let's listen to these Patriotic Millionaires who want their taxes raised, not cut."
12,Sanders,"Today I am thankful for the people who are making the choice to build a more just and equitable food system in this great country. Working together, I know we can achieve it."
13,Sanders,Farmworkers often go unrecognized for their vital contributions to bringing food to our tables. But they are vulnerable to abuse and many have been forced to work in modern-day slavery. The exploitation of farmworkers has no place in a civilized society.
14,Sanders,"The system is worse for Black people and Native Americans, who own less than 4% of farms in the U.S. and are more than twice as likely to be food insecure than the U.S. as a whole. Racial injustice in the food system‚Äîthat is a political choice."
15,Sanders,"Farmers who grew the food we enjoy today only received 12 cents for every dollar spent on Thanksgiving. As agribusinesses get bigger, farmers‚Äô checks get smaller. Allowing massive agribusinesses to push family farmers off the land is a political choice."
16,Sanders,"40 million people go hungry in America each year. Among children, in the richest country on Earth, how outrageous is it that 1 in 5 will go hungry this year? Yet Mr. Trump has proposed $22 billion in cuts to SNAP (food stamps)."
17,Sanders,"As we celebrate, it is hard not to reflect on our broken food system. Millions of Americans are hungry, farmers are going bankrupt, and others are denied access to land. It is not a radical idea to say that we can do better."
18,Sanders,"From my family to yours‚Äîon behalf of Jane, our four kids, seven grandkids and myself‚ÄîI would like to wish everyone a very happy Thanksgiving."
19,Sanders,The coal industry's own research predicted melting polar icecaps and flooding of major cities due to global warming. In 1966.We will look back at the decades of corporate lies and greed blocking climate action as one of the great crimes in history.
20,Sanders,"We can't bring about real change‚Äîhealth care for all, tuition-free public colleges and universities, transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel‚Äîunless we have the guts to point the finger at the ruling class of this country. Their greed is destroying this country."
21,Sanders,"We are in a crisis never before faced by a rich, industrialized democracy. Our people are dying sooner and sooner, many out of despair.If we do not end the pain and suffering of millions of Americans, we will condemn an entire generation to early death."
22,Sanders,"When Trump vetoed our historic legislation to end the horrors in Yemen, the peace movement in this country did not give up‚Äîthey began mobilizing even more strongly.@RepRoKhanna is absolutely right. This is how we are going to stop this unconstitutional war."
23,Sanders,Senator Schumer is right. Congress has got to stand up for the Constitution and tell this lawless president: We are not giving you a Pentagon bill that allows you to partner with the despotic Saudi regime in its horrific war in Yemen.
24,Sanders,"Some CEOs get paid more than 1,000 times their typical employee. Most Americans think the ratio should be 7 to 1.If American corporations can't align closer with American values, then we are going to tax outrageous CEO pay until they do."
25,Sanders,This is a full-blown crisis and Trump is only making it worse. Congress must demonstrate the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry and declare a climate emergency.
26,Sanders,"Trump, a tax dodger who abused and cheated his own workers, has done everything he can to get the government to enrich the billionaire class.Any wonder why Amazon gets away with injuring its warehouse employees and paying $0 in federal taxes?"
27,Sanders,"Our education agenda will not tolerate billionaires like Betsy DeVos. Instead, we will:üè´Stop privatizing public schoolsüë©üèΩ‚Äçüè´Fully fund public education‚ùåCancel all student debt‚öñÔ∏èEnsure that educators, parents, and students get the dignity and respect that they deserve"
28,Sanders,"The Green New Deal for Public Housing is a win-win-win: we will invest in our public housing, address the climate emergency, and create more than 240,000 good-paying jobs."
29,Sanders,"After a lifetime of lying and cheating to enrich himself and his billionaire friends, Mr. Trump‚Äîshock of all shocks‚Äîhas abandoned his campaign promise to have Medicare negotiate drug prices."
30,Sanders,How obscene is a law enforcement system that arrests the survivor of a workplace disaster rather than those who exploit their workers and put them in dangerous conditions? The targeting and demonizing of undocumented people must end immediately.
31,Sanders,"Let‚Äôs be honest and acknowledge that we are seeing a rapid movement toward a political system in which a handful of very wealthy people and special interests determine who gets elected or who does not.¬†That is not, to say the least, what this country is supposed to be about."
32,Sanders,"The greed and impunity of the richest 1% is costing us $5,000,000,000,000. America's wealthiest and most powerful people cannot be above the law. They must pay the taxes they already owe, just like working Americans."
33,Sanders,"Zero-emission electric buses manufactured in America, with good union wages, local hiring, and apprenticeships to bring marginalized communities into the green economy. Sound radical? It's already happening. This is what a Green New Deal is about."
34,Sanders,Fine‚Äîlet‚Äôs call it ‚Äúcommon sense.‚Äù
35,Sanders,"I congratulate @NationalNurses on this major achievement! This is what we can do when workers‚Äîfacing unacceptable violence at their jobs‚Äîcome together, organize, and engage in the political process. Now we must pass this legislation in the Senate without delay."
36,Sanders,"In the richest country in the world, why have 100 rural hospitals closed over the past decade? We know they are less likely to close when more people are covered.We must end the embarrassment of being the only major country not to guarantee health care."
37,Sanders,"Fighting daily, @realDonaldTrump? Drug prices have skyrocketed. Maybe appointing a pharma executive to lower drug prices wasn't such a great idea.If you want to stop wasting time, you should back my Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act, you phony."
38,Sanders,"Jane and I express our condolences to the family of Vermont entrepreneur, Jake Burton. We appreciate his innovations in the sport of snowboarding, and the joy and excitement that he brought to millions throughout the world."
39,Sanders,"We are locking up millions of Americans in cages‚Äîdisproportionately people of color‚Äîbut nobody ever asks, ""How are you going to pay for that?"" I wonder why that is."
40,Sanders,"I‚Äôm having d√©j√† vu as some in Congress repeat the same arguments used to pass the disastrous NAFTA agreement in 1992 to pass Trump‚Äôs NAFTA 2.0 today. Sorry, but the American people won't allow any trade deal to go through that outsources good American jobs this time around."
41,Sanders,It is outrageous that Trump deployed American troops into harm's way to guard Syrian oil wells. Why? He said he wants to make a deal with ExxonMobil to sell that oil. This is illegal and unconstitutional. We must rein him in and stop these endless wars.
42,Sanders,"Good. If we criminalize compassion, we have lost our way as a society. Providing humanitarian aid to men, women and children so that they do not die in the desert‚Äîwhether on the border or anywhere‚Äîis not a crime."
43,Sanders,"How do you explain the mentality of the billionaire Sackler family? They weren't content to destroy thousands of lives for profit in America‚Äîthey had to push opioids on the people of China, too. The level of greed and cruelty is breathtaking."
44,Sanders,"Today, we remember transgender people whose lives were taken. The attacks against transgender people are part of a bigotry which has got to end. To all transgender people I say: We stand with you. #TDOR"
45,Sanders,"Latina workers lose $28,036 annually and $1,121,440 over 40 years compared to what white men make‚Äîbecause they are paid less. That's outrageous. This might be a ""radical"" idea, but maybe it's time for Latinas to get equal pay for equal work."
46,Sanders,"Congratulations to activists for pushing the state to limit fracking in California. Fracking contributes to the climate crisis, increases earthquake risks and threatens our drinking water. Together, we can‚Äîand we will‚Äîban fracking nationwide."
47,Sanders,All people have the right to protest for a better future. I call on the Iranian government to end the internet blackout and stop violence against demonstrators.
48,Sanders,"When I was in the House of Representatives, all the corporations in the world were telling us how great NAFTA would be. I did not buy it. I was right.I will not support any deal that makes American workers compete against people earning pennies an hour."
49,Sanders,I agree with Representative Ilhan Omar: The answer to hate is not more hate; it is compassion.
50,Sanders,The top 1% owe 70% of unpaid taxes. Collecting less than a third of those taxes can fund all of this:üéì Tuition-free college for allüè° A Green New Deal for public housingüö∞ Clean tap water for allüçù Universal school mealsDon't tell me we can't afford to live with dignity.
51,Sanders,"If my memory is correct, this is exactly what the #NoDAPL movement warned about. It is why I stood with them in 2011 to oppose the expansion of the Keystone pipeline. We must clean up this disaster and immediately transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy."
52,Sanders,"I oppose the intervention of Bolivia's security forces in the democratic process and their repression of Indigenous protesters. When the military intervened and asked President Evo Morales to leave, in my view, that‚Äôs called a coup."
53,Sanders,"Israeli settlements in occupied territory are illegal. This is clear from international law and multiple United Nations resolutions. Once again, Mr. Trump is isolating the United States and undermining diplomacy by pandering to his extremist base."
54,Sanders,The system is rigged against working people.
55,Sanders,Looking for a paid internship with Senator Sanders? Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply to be a full-time intern in my D.C. office.
56,Sanders,The American people are united on issue after issue. We must legalize marijuana now‚Äîand expunge all past marijuana convictions as a matter of racial and economic justice.
57,Sanders,"Where did the money from Trump's ""tax cuts for the middle class"" go? To wealthy corporations who have spent $1 trillion buying back their own stock to enrich executives and wealthy shareholders. That's not acceptable."
58,Sanders,"Trump's federal government won't tackle climate change, improve public housing, or create unionized renewable and retrofitting jobs.The solution to these challenges, in my view, is both possible and necessary: we need a Green New Deal for Public Housing."
59,Sanders,"Observing the laws of war is essential to our national security. President Trump pardoned and absolved these soldiers yesterday, overruling his own top security officials. This is wrong and disrespectful to those serving honorably. It makes us less safe."
60,Sanders,"I am proud to have fought over the years for the idea that health care is a human right‚Äînot a privilege. When we pass Medicare for All, it will be because millions of people, over decades, created an unstoppable grassroots movement for justice."
61,Sanders,The Gap corporation didn‚Äôt give a damn about struggling workers as it showered its failing CEO with millions of dollars a year. We will no longer tolerate socialism for the rich and powerful. Congress must pass our Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act.
62,Sanders,"This decision by the parole board is critically important. Rodney Reed's execution should not just be delayed, but canceled.Real criminal justice reform must include joining every other major democracy in eliminating the death penalty."
63,Sanders,"The biggest threats that we face today‚Äîclimate change, inequality, rising authoritarianism, and a refugee crisis‚Äîdo not have military solutions.It's time to stop spending trillions on endless wars and get to work on things that will help America succeed for future generations."
64,Sanders,"Trump should be impeached and he will be impeached. But that does not mean we neglect the other crises facing this country, whether it is the housing crisis or climate change. We are mature enough as a nation to walk and chew bubble gum at the same time."
65,Sanders,Can anyone possibly defend taking away lunch from little kids? Would my GOP colleagues care to work with me and @IlhanMN to end these outrageous stories?We have a bill that wipes out school lunch debt and makes free school meals universal. Let's pass it.
66,Sanders,I thank public housing residents for sharing their stories with us today about their struggles and what green jobs could do for their communities. I am more committed than ever to work with @AOC to pass a Green New Deal and make dignified housing a human right.
67,Sanders,"Sen. Sanders, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, and climate and housing activists lay out how we will transform public housing to create hundreds of thousands of green jobs."
68,Sanders,"It is truly outrageous that at the very same time the Santa Clarita school shooting was happening, Senate Republicans‚Äîled by Mitch McConnell‚Äîrefused to pass gun safety legislation.Congress and Trump must finally have the courage to stand up to the NRA. Enough is enough!"
69,Sanders,Let us not forget: Climate change is the existential crisis of our time. This is the moment for bold action to empower the frontline communities who are most affected as we transform our energy system. This is how we prevent irreparable harm to our planet.
70,Sanders,"You‚Äôre right, @RepAOC. We will ensure a dignified life, with parks, gardens, and community centers, for our public housing residents. We invest $172 billion in retrofits that improve health, safety and comfort‚Äîwhile eliminating all carbon emissions in our public housing."
71,Sanders,"How many jobs are we talking about? üìà Nearly 250,000 good-paying, family-sustaining, union jobs per year across the country if this goes through.üöô At the same time, we reduce carbon pollution on the scale of taking 1.2 million cars off the road over 10 years."
72,Sanders,"Let us be clear: A Green New Deal for Public Housing is not a radical idea. Here‚Äôs why:  40% of all U.S. energy consumption comes from buildings. Our government owns 1 million homes. If we are to defeat climate change, we must transform this housing to produce zero emissions."
73,Sanders,"I am delighted to be standing with @RepAOC, public housing residents, and climate activists to introduce the Green New Deal for Public Housing today. We must boldly take on the housing and climate crises and create millions of jobs."
74,Sanders,"Rep. Tlaib is exactly right. And if these corporations insist on paying their CEOs hundreds of times more than their workers, we will tax them at rate high enough to fund the creation of 230,000 clean energy jobs."
75,Sanders,"Today, I am proud to introduce the Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act with @RepBarbaraLee and @RepRashida. If corporations can't understand why it's absurd to pay their CEOs more in a year than their workers will earn in a lifetime, then maybe this bill will help them figure it out."
76,Sanders,"The student debt crisis is only getting worse. If we can bail out Wall Street banks after they destroyed the U.S. economy, do not tell me we cannot bail out 40 million people whose only crime is trying to get a higher education."
77,Sanders,"These young Dreamers are fighting for their right to live in the only country they've ever known. And they have a message for @realDonaldTrump: We're all human, we're all people, no matter where you're from. Stop being ignorant. We all have the same dreams."
78,Sanders,Trump's attack on the DACA program is the ugliest and most cruel decision made by a president in our modern history.I will do everything I possibly can to protect Dreamers from being thrown out of the only country they have ever known.
79,Sanders,What kind of society do we live in when a mother is charged nearly $1 million by her employer-based insurance for the birth of her own child? The health care system is broken. We need Medicare for All.
80,Sanders,"If you think it is too expensive to take care of our veterans, don't send them to war."
81,Sanders,"On Veterans Day, let us renew our promise to returned service members by ending the injustices that too many of them face, such as homelessness, loneliness, and deportations. We must also strengthen the VA so that veterans and their families get the support they deserve."
82,Sanders,"A retail worker who misses a shift because of an emergency can be fired on the spot. But what happened when Gap's CEO oversaw sales and stock declines? He got a 33% pay raise and made $20 million a year‚Äî3,500 times more than his workers. Obscene."
83,Sanders,"50 years ago, every dollar of an estate over $10 million was taxed at a rate of 77 percent. Since then, wealthy elites have worked to gut the estate tax‚Äîand inequality has exploded. Our job: Bring back this critical tool to stop the rise of oligarchy."
84,Sanders,"In the richest country in the world, no child should be poisoned by contaminated water coming through their faucet. What has gone on in Flint, where 30,000 kids have been exposed to neurotoxins, is a crime and an obscenity."
85,Sanders,"We have got to join the rest of the developed world and abolish the death penalty. Too many innocent people, particularly people of color, get caught up in this unjust policy. A civilized society should not be involved in the murder of other Americans."
86,Sanders,"Despite GOP efforts to sabotage health care for millions of Americans, the Affordable Care Act is still the law.Spread the word: You can sign up for health insurance today. Open enrollment runs until December 15. Go to https://t.co/abvyRmbFsY to choose a plan and get covered."
87,Sanders,"Philadelphia police stopped 25,000 cars because they ""smelled marijuana."" 84% were African American drivers. They found marijuana only 12% of the time.Our job must be to end the War on Drugs‚Äîand get racial bias out of law enforcement at the same time."
88,Sanders,"Seven decades ago, the British people put in place a system that treats health care as a human right. Today they live longer than Americans, infant mortality is lower, and they spend half of what we do on health care.It‚Äôs time we join the rest of the industrialized world."
89,Sanders,Mr. Trump said he'd fight for a trade policy to help American workers. He said he'd lower the trade deficit. He lied: It's gone up. His real agenda: Protect the profits of the pharmaceutical industry and make it easier for corporations to outsource jobs.
90,Sanders,"Nicole Smith-Holt‚Äôs son Alec died at 26 because he was rationing insulin that was too expensive. Every day, Americans are suffering and dying because of the greed of Big Pharma. We need to share these stories and stand together to fight back."
91,Sanders,"Facebook has incredible power over the economy and our political life. It harvests the data of 228 million Americans and, over and over, uses this sensitive information in dangerous ways. What we need is vigorous antitrust action and to break Facebook up."
92,Sanders,3.2 million more people are in poverty than official statistics show‚Äîhow? Inflation is higher for the poorest than it is for the average person.This is more evidence of what we already know: the economy is rigged and it benefits the wealthiest the most.
93,Sanders,"Now, thanks to the FCC under Mr. Trump, many Americans will only be able to choose from three huge corporations for their wireless service: Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile. This trend of unending corporate consolidation goes against the interests of consumers and our democracy."
94,Sanders,"11,258 scientists from 153 countries came together to say: ""Scientists have a moral obligation to clearly warn humanity of any catastrophic threat and tell it like it is."" It's time we listen. Congress must declare a climate emergency and act boldly to protect our only home."
95,Sanders,"Republicans all over the country are trying to make it harder for people of color, poor people, and older people to participate in our democracy. Our agenda:üó≥Ô∏è Extend early votingüåÉ Extend voting hoursüá∫üá∏ Make #ElectionDay a holiday"
96,Sanders,"If Trump was serious about a solution to the horrendous conflict in Yemen, he would have signed our War Powers Resolution into law and ended illegal military support to the Saudis. Instead, he vetoed it. Thousands of Yemeni children have died on his watch."
97,Sanders,"Iran's resumption of work at Fordow is a concerning step. We had a deal in place that capped Iran‚Äôs nuclear program, which Trump recklessly violated. We should rejoin the JCPOA immediately and talk to Iran about other regional issues."
98,Sanders,"During his campaign, Trump said over and over again that he would stick it to the wealthy by closing the egregious carried interest loophole. Guess what? His disgraceful tax bill did nothing to address it and even Fox Business commentators are fed up with his broken promises."
99,Sanders,"Secretary Pompeo, I hate to break it to you, but plunging the world in to a full-scale climate catastrophe is nothing to be proud of."
100,Sanders,"Well, what do you know? One of the Wall Street ratings agencies complicit in the worst financial crash in modern history is warning of the dangers of bailing out students‚Äînot the crooks who run the big banks. Thanks for the advice. But we are going to cancel all student debt."
101,Sanders,"Here‚Äôs an idea: How about an agenda that isn‚Äôt about corporate trade deals that sell out our workers, tax cuts for billionaires, and endless war? For once let‚Äôs focus on dignity for the working class. Let‚Äôs create millions of good jobs to take care of each other and our planet."
102,Sanders,"‚òÄÔ∏èSolar‚Äî¬¢4.3/kWhüí®Wind‚Äî¬¢4.2/kWhüõ¢Coal‚Äî¬¢10/kWh‚ò¢Ô∏èNuclear‚Äî¬¢15/kWh As renewable costs fall, there is no technological obstacle to transforming our energy system to create millions of good jobs. What we need now is the political will for a Green New Deal."
103,Sanders,"Trump is a good example that if you put your mind to it and work hard, you can betray just about every promise you make and deny every reality that exists."
104,Sanders,All of us can be a little forgetful sometimes. My Republican friends launched trillion-dollar wars and passed huge tax cuts for the rich. Then they ask why the deficit went up.
105,Sanders,"Congratulations to the UK‚Äôs grassroots activists for successfully banning fracking. We know fracking contaminates our water. We know it pollutes the air we breathe. We know it fuels climate change. Together, we can‚Äîand we will‚Äîban fracking in America, too."
106,Sanders,"How do we pay for quality health care, guaranteed to all our people? Pretty simple, in my view. The way every other rich country does. #MedicareForAll"
107,Sanders,"Since 2011, I opposed the KeystoneXL pipeline. I feared that more dirty tar sands oil infrastructure would lead to disastrous spills. As 380,000 gallons of crude oil contaminate North Dakota's rural wetlands, we have got to say: Enough. It's time for a Green New Deal."
108,Sanders,"What if the media told the American people every day that the richest 400 billionaires pay lower taxes than the middle class and the working poor? What if, when politicians say we must make do with less, the media admitted we're being played for"
109,Sanders,"I voted against the Patriot Act. It created an Orwellian system of mass surveillance. We must now end the NSA's unconstitutional data collection on hundreds of millions of calls. Intelligence agencies cannot unjustly surveil activists, Muslim Americans, and people of color."
110,Sanders,"I applaud @CTULocal1's teachers for achieving better pay, smaller class sizes, and more nurses and social workers in Chicago's schools. This is what solidarity is about‚Äîfighting for the whole community. When workers stand together, I have no doubt we will transform America."
111,Sanders,Jeff Bezos' income per day: $215 millionFederal taxes Amazon pays: $0Amazon's spending to buy Seattle's City Council: $1.6 millionThe only way we take back our democracy and end this obscene system of oligarchy is by standing up and fighting back.
112,Sanders,"Want to talk about clearing a low bar, Senator McConnell?Here's one: Explain to the 750,000 Kentuckians living in poverty why you won't put a $15 minimum wage bill on the Senate floor that would raise their wages and those of 39 million Americans."
113,Sanders,"Mr. Trump, the American people read the call summary.That is why the House is voting to proceed with an impeachment inquiry at this very moment. https://t.co/ISxYHnXrXe"
114,Sanders,"En Chile, un presidente multimillionario impone austeridad mientras el ejercito reprime a los manifestantes. Miles han sido detenidos. Ante la historia de Chile, esto es peligroso. La soluci√≥n es obvia aqu√≠ y en el mundo. Devuelve el poder donde debe estar: con la clase obrera."
115,Sanders,"In Chile, a billionaire president pushes austerity while the military represses protesters. Thousands have been arrested. Knowing Chile's history, this is very dangerous. The solution here and across the world is obvious. Put power where it belongs: with working people."
116,Sanders,"Unions don't just mean better wages and benefits. Workers organize to protect each other from abusive bosses, harassment and discrimination. I stand in solidarity with these employees fighting for a fair workplace on behalf of all workers at NBC."
117,Sanders,"CEO-to-worker pay gaps:Gap, Inc.: 3,566 to 1McDonald's: 2,124 to 1Disney: 1,424 to 1Walmart: 1,076 to 1When the middle class is rebuilt, we will look back on this period in history and say, ""This was wrong. Why on Earth did we allow this kind of grotesque inequality?"""
118,Sanders,Looking for a paid internship? Apply to intern in the office of Senator Sanders here:
119,Sanders,"I‚Äôm from Brooklyn. New York wouldn‚Äôt be one of the greatest cities in the world without the 40,000 transit workers @TWULocal100 who run the bus and subway systems. They keep New York moving and deserve a fair contract with good wages, benefits and job security. #TWURally2019"
120,Sanders,"The death toll in Yemen's war could grow to 230,000 by the year's end. Trump vetoed our bill to stop U.S. military involvement, but Congress can still prohibit it. And we must. I look forward to working with Armed Services Ranking Member Reed to end this humanitarian nightmare."
121,Sanders,Access to a safe and legal abortion is a constitutional right.
122,Sanders,"Surviving a wildfire is like experiencing hell on Earth. If we know that climate change makes these fires more frequent and widespread, why aren't we working together to pass a Green New Deal?"
123,Sanders,It‚Äôs been over 10 years since the federal minimum wage was raised to $7.25 an hour and over 100 days since the House passed the Raise the Wage Act. No American should be in poverty. Workers need a living wage. Mr. McConnell: do your duty and bring the bill to the Senate floor.
124,Sanders,"On #NationalImmigrantsDay, I am proud of our country for welcoming millions around the world seeking refuge from violence, racism and poverty‚Äîpeople like my father who came here from Poland at the age of 17.This is the America that we must be."
125,Sanders,This is what a climate emergency looks like. We must bring the full weight of the federal government to bear to help the people of California. We need to deal with the impacts that are already here and act decisively to prevent a much bigger catastrophe.
126,Sanders,"The time has come to fulfill and expand upon FDR‚Äôs vision that he laid out 75 years ago.These are not radical ideas. They're supported by the majority of Americans. Working together, we can and must achieve economic, social, racial, political and environmental justice for all."
127,Sanders,Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was a murderer and terrorist responsible for terrible suffering and death. The fight against ISIS would not be possible without the brave efforts of the Kurds and other U.S. allies.
128,Sanders,"African-Americans are almost 4 times as likely to have force used on them by police‚Äîthis is unacceptable. The time is long overdue for us to end ""stop and frisk"" practices, demilitarize our police departments, and reform our racist criminal justice system."
129,Sanders,"The richest 400 billionaires pay lower taxes than everyone else. In my view, this obscene inequality in wealth and political power is not compatible with a democratic society. I am proud to support the introduction of the For The 99.8% Act in the House by @RepJimmyGomez."
130,Sanders,How can we talk about problems of crime without mentioning that we have one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the industrialized world? Building all the jails in the world will not make this right.
131,Sanders,"Mr. President, this is the exact opposite of what halting endless war looks like. Congress has not authorized you to use our troops to secure Syria‚Äôs oil.Read the Constitution, Article I."
132,Sanders,"I've said it before: Betsy DeVos is the worst Secretary of Education in modern history. Instead of standing up for victims of fraud, she is profiting off of them. Our country needs an advocate for students, not a billionaire working on behalf of predatory lenders."
133,Sanders,"Life-threatening diseases linked to Agent Orange are afflicting 83,000 veterans of the Vietnam War‚Äîand the White House refuses to cover their care. This is outrageous. @SenatorTester and I are demanding these veterans get the coverage they deserve now. No more excuses."
134,Sanders,"It is unfortunate that Trump officials have to resign in order to shed light on the huge debt burden for students. We must cancel student loan debt‚Äîbut not just some of it. All $1,675,469,158,747."
135,Sanders,Right-wing extremists in every state and every branch of government have worked for decades to make it more and more difficult for women to access abortion. We cannot let them win. Abortion is a constitutional right that must be protected.
136,Sanders,"This major settlement will benefit the people of Vermont, who have been hurt and misled by opioid distributors like Reckitt. I am proud of our state‚Äôs Attorney General for taking the fight to the pharmaceutical industry, and winning."
137,Sanders,"The average cost of 4-year college in the United States: $23,091 The average cost of 4-year college in France: $212 Education is one of the keys to a successful democracy, so why are we making it so hard for our people to learn?"
138,Sanders,"We are putting corporate America on notice: treat your workers with fairness and dignity. When workers strike and secure better wages and benefits, we embolden workers everywhere to stand up and fight too. This is how we rebuild our middle class."
139,Sanders,Let‚Äôs be absolutely clear about what Republicans are doing by adding new paperwork and requirements to Medicaid: they are attacking the poor and threatening lives.
140,Sanders,"President Trump announced he will keep troops in Syria to protect oil fields. Last I checked, Congress never authorized U.S. forces to be deployed to secure Syria‚Äôs economic resources. Putting U.S. forces in harm‚Äôs way for this purpose is illegal and unconstitutional."
141,Sanders,It is completely unacceptable for a quid pro quo regarding personal political goals to determine the conduct of U.S. foreign policy. The House should continue its impeachment inquiry and expose the full nature of the most corrupt presidency in modern history.
142,Sanders,"Big surprise: the president is a liar. Far from ""ending the endless wars,"" Mr. Trump has ended no wars and deployed more troops to the Middle East."
143,Sanders,"The Arab Spring rose up to fight corruption, repression, inequality and austerity. The Lebanon and Iraq protests show this spirit is still very much alive. If we want a progressive future, we need to build up a global movement of and for working people."
144,Sanders,"No, Mr. Trump. ‚ÄúLynching‚Äù was a campaign of racial terror by white supremacists who murdered thousands of African-American men, women, and children. If you are nervous about an impeachment process, then you should not have violated the Constitution."
145,Sanders,"I think it is pretty sick to knowingly sell a product that will destroy the planet and our children's futures, but that is the mindset of a fossil fuel billionaire. It's time for a Green New Deal and an end to this disease of lying for profit."
146,Sanders,"It turns out that when you put people over profits, society is better off."
147,Sanders,"In one of the wealthiest countries in the history of the world, no one should be in poverty. The current $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage is a starvation wage and must be increased to a living wage of $15 an hour. Time for the Senate to do its job and take a vote."
148,Sanders,"Congratulations to the Burlington High School women's soccer team on taking this courageous step. I myself am a baseball fan, but no matter the sport, I hope all fans and athletes can agree on this: Equal pay for equal work, full stop."
149,Sanders,The Supreme Court just allowed Michigan to continue gerrymandering districts to benefit Republicans.Our job: Fight back. Expand voter turnout. Make state legislatures and courts end partisan gerrymandering. Overturn Citizens United. Create a vibrant democracy.
150,Sanders,"Mr. Trump's NAFTA 2.0 will not stop the outsourcing of jobs I warned against on the picket lines in 1993.We need a trade policy that ends the race to the bottom, not another one of Trump‚Äôs corporate giveaways."
151,Sanders,"For vulture fund CEO Paul Singer, it seems having $3.5 billion is not enough. He is now trying to profit from taking AT&amp;T workers' jobs, wages and benefits. @RoKhanna and @CWAUnion are right. We must tell the Paul Singers of the world: Enough is enough."
152,Sanders,"""School lunch debt"" is not a phrase that should exist.@Ilhan and I want to eliminate all of it."
153,Sanders,"This American woman experienced what it's like to have universal health care in the UK, and guess what? Now she doesn't want to move back to the United States."
154,Sanders,"Imagine cancelling all student debt and making every public college tuition-free, so that the rich aren't vacationing off the backs of struggling students. Now stop imagining. Let's tax Wall Street and do it."
155,Sanders,"Billy Foister was one of 125,000 Americans toiling in Amazon's warehouses for Jeff Bezos‚Äîa billionaire who makes $150,000 per minute. Just sickening. @OSHA_DOL must launch a comprehensive investigation now."
156,Sanders,"Purdue Pharma used its wealth, power, and army of lawyers to bully West Virginia officials and get away with murder. Who has to live with the consequences of opioid executives' greed? Thousands of innocent kids now in foster homes and emergency shelters."
157,Sanders,"If we make lunch free for all kids, kids do better in school. It‚Äôs as simple as that. To ensure that all kids are prepared to be successful, now is the time to make all school meals universal."
158,Sanders,"Congratulations to our neighbors to the north on completing their first year of marijuana legalization! Vermont shares a border with Canada, and as far as I can tell, the sky has not fallen and the cities have not plunged into anarchy on the other side."
159,Sanders,"If we do not pass a Green New Deal, Mr. Trump's resort is likely to be swallowed by sea-level rise before the century ends because of catastrophic climate change.Maybe when it is underwater he'll have a harder time calling global warming a ""hoax."""
160,Sanders,‚ÄúHow can we afford it?‚ÄùIt‚Äôs a question critics ask any time I propose a bold new program like College for All. The answer in this case is very simple: with a small fee on Wall Street that will end reckless financial speculation.
161,Sanders,"Through our efforts to make prescription drugs affordable and expand dental care, I saw how committed he was to a more compassionate, humane society. He will be sorely missed. Our thoughts are with his family today."
162,Sanders,"Jane and I are deeply saddened by the loss of our good  friend, Rep. Elijah Cummings. I was honored to work closely with him over the years. His integrity and moral vision for his community and the country were extraordinary."
163,Sanders,"The greed of opioid manufacturers has taken hundreds of thousands of lives, and the epidemic they created cost us $631 billion over the past four years alone.Now they're cutting a deal to pay $18 billion for their wrongdoing. Outrageous."
164,Sanders,"Let us be very clear: Medicare for All will boost pay and benefits for workers across this country. That's why unions are organizing to get rid of corporate greed in our health care system. Thank you, @RepJayapal and @RepDebDingell, for your strong leadership in this fight."
165,Sanders,"In our system of government, Congress alone controls government spending. And we did not give Trump the money to waste on his damn wall. I say this with no great pleasure, but we have a President of the United States who has not read, or does not understand, the Constitution."
166,Sanders,"The ecological crisis has gotten worse and worse, decade after decade, and yet the corporate media still refuse to take it seriously.We will not bring about the political change needed to tackle the climate emergency until we address this."
167,Sanders,@Ilhan 75% of school districts have unpaid student meal debt. This bill will:‚úÖ Prohibit school lunch programs from denying children hot meals‚úÖ Wipe out existing delinquent meal debt and stop harassment of families‚úÖ Increase reimbursement rates to schools for meal preparation
168,Sanders,"I am proud to unveil, with Rep. @Ilhan Omar, a bill to ensure that every child in America has access to school meals.In the richest country in the history of the world, we must not tolerate the obscenity of kids going hungry while they're trying to learn."
169,Sanders,"The national security experts who led this letter are exactly right: Congress must block taxpayer dollars from funding this illegal war. We have a chance to not only end the suffering of Yemenis, but ensure that America is never again embroiled in another unconstitutional war."
170,Sanders,"I applaud Ecuador‚Äôs Indigenous-led grassroots movements who stood up to repression and blocked the IMF's austerity agenda. Economic elites keep pushing austerity worldwide, making life unbearable for working people. The U.S. should stop supporting this."
171,Sanders,I don't accept people hiding behind the American flag to give tax breaks to the rich and throw billions upon billions of dollars at the military-industrial complex. Who is patriotic and who is not? It's an interesting question.
172,Sanders,Trump is working to:‚Ä¢ enable corporate tax evasion‚Ä¢ let factories dump toxic chemicals into wetlands‚Ä¢ limit food inspections ‚Ä¢ collect debt from defrauded students‚Ä¢ increase car pollutionThis is the most corrupt presidency in modern history.
173,Sanders,This phony ‚Äúanti-war‚Äù president vetoed our bill to get American troops out of the illegal war in Yemen. He has ignored Congress‚Äôs power to declare war. He‚Äôs spent years intensifying Middle East conflicts without giving a damn about the Constitution.Trump is a liar and a fraud.
174,Sanders,"When I reflect on how this country passed Social Security in 1935 and Medicare in 1965, I think about how much poverty and suffering we ended.Our next step is Medicare for All. When we succeed, future generations will appreciate how we made health care a human right in America."
175,Sanders,"Some argue that the U.S. is not really engaged in hostilities in Yemen. But when Yemenis see ""Made in USA"" on the bombs killing their children, it‚Äôs very clear that the United States is part of this horrible war. This must end."
176,Sanders,@workerism This is exactly right. Wage theft is a crime and workers should stand up to it. We need a powerful labor movement to end the obscenity of businesses robbing billions of dollars from their own employees every year.
177,Sanders,Inequality is at a 100-year high. 400 billionaires pay lower taxes than fast-food workers. Wages have gone nowhere. The power elite need to come clean. Admit to the American people that the trickle-down economics you've sold us for 40 years is a racket.
178,Sanders,"Very proud of Vermont and other jurisdictions for leading the way. This is a critical victory for immigrants across the United States, who should never have to fear risking their status in order to access basic services."
179,Sanders,"Remember when Donald Trump tweeted that he was ""trying to end the endless wars?"" That was yesterday. Today he's sending thousands of troops, warplanes, and missiles to his dictator friends in Saudi Arabia to escalate military tensions with Iran."
180,Sanders,Trump's Pentagon is run by a former Raytheon lobbyist. So of course an official who successfully eliminated billions in Pentagon waste and abuse was forced out. It's time to slash our bloated military budget and use the savings to solve real human needs.
181,Sanders,"Climate strikers, led by our young people, are on the march for environmental justice. They are changing our national conversation and building an unstoppable movement. Together, we will transform this country and pass a Green New Deal."
182,Sanders,"I believe decent housing, good health care, and a quality education are human rights that everyone should have. Under our ruthless economic system, they are commodities whose costs keep rising as Americans‚Äô wages stagnate. This is why we fight."
183,Sanders,"Think of the alternative to these power outages and intense wildfires if America tackles climate change. We can build a smart, safe, and modern electrical grid that gives every American access to clean, cheap, and reliable energy from renewables."
184,Sanders,"Almost half of all Americans will experience a mental illness during their lifetime. We have to take care of one another. In the wealthiest nation in the world, all of us, regardless of income, should have access to mental health care as a right. #WorldMentalHealthDay"
185,Sanders,"I noticed, and I'm pretty damn sure patients with breast cancer and their families will notice too."
186,Sanders,"I have long believed that democracy isn't just voting every four years‚Äîit‚Äôs about ordinary people creating community, engaging in the political process together, and building powerful grassroots movements to achieve progressive change. And that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre doing."
187,Sanders,Congress must assert its important responsibility over foreign policy and serve as a check on this unstable president.
188,Sanders,"This is not a case of sending American troops there. They are already there and Trump is withdrawing them, giving the Turkish Army permission to invade.Kurdish fighters have fought and died in our joint effort to eliminate ISIS. They should not be abandoned in this way."
189,Sanders,"I condemn Trump's reckless decision to abandon our Kurdish allies to their fate at the hands of Turkish President Erodogan.The President of the United States should not make significant national security decisions impulsively, by tweet, after a single phone call."
190,Sanders,"In America today, we are overpaying for subpar health care. Why? Corporate greed.Medicare for All would save both dollars and lives. It is time that we finally join every other major country in the world and guarantee health care for all."
191,Sanders,"I say, with @MrDannyGlover, to Trump: We will not let you destroy a generational source of good, unionized jobs for the African-American community. We should modernize and expand the U.S. Postal Service to offer basic banking solutions‚Äînot privatize it."
192,Sanders,I applaud the activists whose efforts led the Trump Organization to cancel this event. Anti-Muslim bigotry has no place in American political life.
193,Sanders,Think of how broken our economic system is. A warehouse worker whose bathroom break goes too long gets threatened with being fired. A typical consequence for a CEO who runs a corporation to the ground? Millions of more dollars in salary and bonuses.
194,Sanders,"If the Supreme Court wants to be on the right side of history, it must recognize that transgender people are entitled to the same civil and human rights as everybody else. Period."
195,Sanders,We now know the richest 400 Americans have rigged the system to pay lower taxes than everyone else in the country.The question of our time is this: will we tolerate it? Or will we take back our democracy from the oligarchs who run this country?
196,Sanders,I have long believed the U.S. must responsibly end our military interventions in the Middle East. But Trump‚Äôs abrupt announcement to withdraw from northern Syria and endorse Turkey‚Äôs incursion is extremely irresponsible. It is likely to result in more suffering and instability.
197,Sanders,"I am glad to be home in Burlington to rest for a little bit. I want to thank all of you for your well wishes, love, and support over the week. I am recovering well and feeling much better. I am more determined than ever to fight alongside you to make health care a human right."
198,Sanders,Fast-food workers too often face starvation wages and unjust working conditions. Forming a union is the best way to give workers a voice to get fair treatment from billion-dollar corporations.I support the workers leading the fight for $15 and a
199,Sanders,"For over a year, Haitians have demonstrated against government corruption and rising costs. As protests grow, I am concerned about increased violence. Using live ammunition against protesters and journalists violates basic human rights and is unacceptable."
200,Sanders,"This ruling threatens to give more power to unaccountable companies like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon over what we see and do on the internet. We must fight to keep the internet free and open‚Äînot dominated by corporations. This struggle is essential to free speech and democracy."
201,Sanders,"The American people are not falling for billionaires' anti-worker propaganda. Support for unions is near a 50-year high. More unions will rebuild the middle class, combat corporate greed, and ensure that workers get their fair share. The labor movement makes our country strong."
202,Sanders,"The greed of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citigroup and BlackRock is insatiable. Who cares if the Saudis are starving millions of Yemeni civilians or that our planet faces a climate emergency? Profiting off of $1.5 trillion in Saudi oil is just too important."
203,Sanders,"CEOs say they want to make a social impact. Here's a way to do that: Instead of making 300 times more than their employees, maybe they should raise workers' wages and try getting by on 30 times more. Top CEOs in America did this not so long ago and somehow managed to survive."
204,Sanders,A Green New Deal isn't just about the climate‚Äîit is about preventing hunger and illness. The time for incremental change has passed. We must fight to rapidly transform our energy system.
205,Sanders,Alec Smith died at 26 because he was rationing insulin that was too expensive. Corporate greed is taking the lives of Americans and it needs to end now.
206,Sanders,Tax Wall Street and cancel it.
207,Sanders,This behavior toward @RepJayapal as she performed her House duties is unacceptable. I voted against creating ICE because I feared the agency and its leaders would act with impunity. We need an immigration system that respects human rights and Congress's oversight authority.
208,Sanders,We have got to get to the bottom of this. The American people have a right to know what deals Trump might be making with the murderous Saudi dictator that he loves so much.
209,Sanders,"This is what a rigged economy looks like: While labor productivity has more than doubled since the late 1960s, nearly half of all new income since 1993 has gone to the top 1 percent.Meanwhile Americans continue to work some of the longest hours on earth."
210,Sanders,"The undemocratic fiscal control board of Puerto Rico is still working hand in hand with Wall Street, with a plan for more austerity and slashed pensions. The board must stop dictating Puerto Rico‚Äôs economic decisions and let the people decide their future."
211,Sanders,"Today, millions of climate strikers, led by a global youth movement, showed politicians around the world that the demand for environmental justice is not going away. It is only growing stronger. Together, we will pass a Green New Deal."
212,Sanders,Mr. Trump made a series of disastrous choices this week‚Äîdecisions that tear at the fabric of what this country is about. This is one of them. We must not turn our backs on refugees fleeing horrific violence and persecution around the world.
213,Sanders,This Republican mayor leads the first city in Texas powered by 100% renewable energy. Addressing climate change and creating millions of good-paying jobs in the process should not be a partisan issue.
214,Sanders,"Make no mistake about it: Canceling student debt is an act of social, racial and economic justice."
215,Sanders,It is the right of all people to protest for a better future. The Egyptian government should refrain from violence against protesters exercising this right. The world is watching.
216,Sanders,"Inequality in America is at its worst level in more than 50 years. Maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîit's time we start taxing the super-rich to ensure human rights for all Americans: housing, health care, education, retirement, good jobs, and a livable planet."
217,Sanders,"As a corporate lawyer and lobbyist, Eugene Scalia made millions working for Chevron, Goldman Sachs, Facebook and other huge corporations, helping them undermine health and safety regulations. So naturally he's Trump's pick to lead the Labor Department. Obscene."
218,Sanders,"Medicare for All will lower overall health care costs. Meanwhile:üìàFamily premiums are up 54%‚Äî$20,000 a yearüìàDeductibles up 162%‚Äî$1,655 a yearBut I'm sure the American people getting robbed blind by the insurance industry are just thrilled these costs aren't called ""taxes."""
219,Sanders,There is a metaphorical wildfire happening in our oceans that will devastate our planet‚Äôs marine ecosystems and coastal communities. We must immediately take aggressive action to address this global emergency before it is too late.
220,Sanders,Trump's cruelty and xenophobia never stops: ICE wants to send women and moms back to a for-profit detention center where there is a pattern of suicide and abuse. I support the efforts of @RAICESTEXAS and other organizers to prevent this from happening.
221,Sanders,"The President has left the House of Representatives no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry. I believe impeachable offenses were committed, and the House will now lay out the case. No president is above the law, and it is our responsibility to safeguard the Constitution."
222,Sanders,"Trump is depriving 500,000 kids of their school lunches for no damn reason‚Äîeven after 139 members of Congress warned him not to. I cannot begin to understand the casual cruelty that motivates Trump and his billionaire friends to harm vulnerable children like this."
223,Sanders,"The White House sent us their talking points around President Trump‚Äôs Ukraine call.For some strange reason, they forgot to mention that Mr. Trump said, ‚ÄúI would like you to do us a favor though‚Äù after Zelensky brought up military aid."
224,Sanders,"A message to Wall Street: We will investigate your corruption. We will not let you cut the schools, hospitals and pensions that the Puerto Rican people need to live with dignity and recover from Hurricane Maria."
225,Sanders,.@AOC and I stand with the Puerto Ricans who flooded into the streets to demand democratic control over their lives. Puerto Rico's working families have suffered enough austerity. It's time to impose some austerity on the banks destroying the island.
226,Sanders,"When Mr. Trump blames immigrants for crime, he spreading a racist lie.Instead of frightening 11 million undocumented people with deportation, we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship."
227,Sanders,"While Trump and the GOP cut taxes for the top 1%, they want to return us to a time when workers could not engage in collective bargaining. Unions are the backbone of America's middle class. Graduate student workers must have the right to join a union and earn a living wage."
228,Sanders,What a disgrace that it takes a 16-year-old to tell world leaders what they won't acknowledge: We cannot continue with this type of ruthless capitalism that is destroying our planet. This is why we need young people leading our climate justice movement.
229,Sanders,"Today is Native American Women‚Äôs Equal Pay Day, which marks how long a Native woman has to work into 2019 to catch up to the same amount a white man made in 2018. We must continue the fight for pay parity. This is not a radical issue, this is an issue of fairness and justice."
230,Sanders,"General Motors made $11 billion last year. Their CEO was paid $22 million, nearly 300 times as much as their median worker.The workers who make GM‚Äôs success possible deserve health care and good wages. I know which side I'm on."
231,Sanders,"Trump calls Egypt's Sisi his 'favorite dictator.'I believe the United States should stand for human rights, especially with governments that receive large amounts of US aid, as Egypt does. All people have the right to protest for a better future. Sisi should respect that right."
232,Sanders,"Dwight D. Eisenhower was not a radical socialist‚Äîhe was a Republican. And in 1961, he tried to warn us about the ""military industrial complex."""
233,Sanders,"I am proud to stand with these civil rights organizations. In the fight for marijuana legalization, we must prioritize racial and economic justice‚Äîthat means revenues from this industry must be invested in the communities that have been devastated by the so-called ""war on drugs."""
234,Sanders,What gives me hope right now is this new generation of young people who dream big and do not want to settle for the status quo. #ClimateStrike
235,Sanders,"More than 1,000 Amazon employees have courageously challenged the richest man in the world over Amazon's massive carbon footprint‚Äîand they have already achieved results. I want to thank them and workers around the world who are walking off the job today for climate justice."
236,Sanders,"For too long, the mainstream media has ignored science and given a platform to climate change deniers. I am glad they are finally starting to give this issue the attention it deserves, and I am calling on them to continue shedding light on the seriousness of this global crisis."
237,Sanders,"It is unconscionable that amid global climate protests, tech giants like Microsoft are announcing major partnerships with Big Oil.We must hold them accountable, demand they break ties with the fossil fuel industry, and move rapidly to sustainable energy."
238,Sanders,Young people have already demonstrated they can take on powerful fossil fuel companies and force politicians to answer their call to action. To the millions of young people and allies worldwide who are striking today to demand climate justice: I stand with you. #ClimateStrike
239,Sanders,"As thousands of people take to the streets today to demand bold climate change solutions, people in Texas are facing serious flooding. Our thoughts are with the people in southeast Texas. We will do everything we can to help those communities recover."
240,Sanders,"Two years ago, Hurricane Mar√≠a‚Äîfueled by climate change‚Äîdevastated Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our message for the people of those islands: you are not forgotten. We will fight for you, as American citizens, to fully rebuild for a sustainable and resilient future."
241,Sanders,99% of applications for loan forgiveness in this program are being rejected. The Department of Education is failing our public service workers and students. Our job:- Stand up to Betsy DeVos and the predatory lenders- Cancel student debt and make public colleges tuition-free
242,Sanders,"A U.S. airstrike was intended for ISIS, but killed 30 Afghan civilians. This is just one of the horrors of endless war. ISIS did not even exist when America invaded Afghanistan 18 years ago. We need to end our longest war and bring our troops home."
243,Sanders,"Think of how corrupt our political and economic system truly is. Instead of worrying about jail time, the billionaire culprits of America's opioid crisis have the audacity to ask for millions in bonuses for their top employees.We need a political revolution in this country."
244,Sanders,"Ady is fighting two difficult battles at once: one against the horrific disease of ALS, and another against the insatiable greed of the insurance and drug companies. When we pass Medicare for All, it will be because of heroes like him who stood up and fought back."
245,Sanders,This is why we need Medicare for All.
246,Sanders,".@SecPompeo: An attack on Saudi oil is NOT an attack on America. If you want a war, come to Congress to make your case. We will not let you drag the American people into another catastrophe in the Middle East.Your job is to use diplomacy to resolve conflict‚Äînot incite more war."
247,Sanders,"U.S. trade agreements should stop the outsourcing of jobs, end the race to the bottom, protect the environment and lower the outrageously high price of prescription drugs. @RepDebDingell is right: Trump‚Äôs NAFTA 2.0 falls far short of those standards."
248,Sanders,"Trump says he loves business and states' rights. Except when automakers and the state of California worked together to reduce car emissions. How sick do you have to be, in the face of a climate emergency, to have your EPA block this effort to cut tailpipe pollution?"
249,Sanders,".@HasanMinhaj is right. Instead of just worrying about Wall Street, maybe it's time we start worrying about the 45 million Americans with $1.6 trillion in student debt. We could start by canceling it."
250,Sanders,"""I am alive today not because of insurance companies but despite them."" We are the only major country that allows private insurance companies to rip us off, rob us of our health, and drive our people into financial or emotional catastrophe."
251,Sanders,"Congratulations to the students pushing the University of California to join more than a thousand institutions in divesting from fossil fuels. If we want to leave future generations a planet that is healthy and habitable, we must transform our energy system to sustainable energy."
252,Sanders,"Average cost of a C-section:üá™üá∏ $2,352üá¨üáß $4,435üá¶üá∫ $5,186üá´üá∑ $6,441üá∫üá∏ $15,041We can afford Medicare for All. What we can't afford is continuing to charge women in the U.S. more than any other country for giving birth."
253,Sanders,"As many as 22 million people‚Äîdouble the populations of New York City and Chicago combined‚Äîcould be displaced by global warming this year. When we say that climate change is an emergency, this is what @AOC, @RepBlumenauer and I are talking about."
254,Sanders,"What are our priorities when it takes 10 years to get food insecurity back down to a level before Wall Street crashed the economy?1 in 9 families still go hungry in the world's richest country. If we are to end hunger, ordinary people must get involved in the political process."
255,Sanders,"Mr. Trump, the Constitution of the United States is perfectly clear. Only Congress‚Äînot the president‚Äîcan declare war. And Congress will not give you the authority to start another disastrous war in the Middle East just because the brutal Saudi dictatorship told you to."
256,Sanders,"A federal report I commissioned confirms it: poverty is killing our people. A man in McDowell County, West Virginia, dies at 67‚Äîthe same life expectancy as a man in India. Just 350 miles away, in Fairfax, VA, a man lives to 82‚Äîthe same as in Switzerland. This is just obscene."
257,Sanders,"I said it in 1993 and I will say it again now: If you want a simpler, more cost-effective health care system, the way forward is a Medicare for All, single-payer program."
258,Sanders,"200 days ago, Nancy Pelosi and her House colleagues passed expanded background checks, taking common-sense action to prevent another horrific mass shooting.What has Mitch McConnell done? Nothing but the NRA's bidding.Do your damn job, Senator."
259,Sanders,"Here's the business model: ‚Ä¢ Flood the country with painkillers‚Ä¢ Lie about the addictive effects‚Ä¢ Start opioid epidemic ‚Ä¢ Cut a deal, admit no wrongdoing‚Ä¢ Hide money in Swiss bank accountsThe billionaire Sackler family must be held criminally liable for their greed."
260,Sanders,Wall Street billionaires have cooked up a new scheme: buying up health clinics so they can charge unsuspecting patients insane ‚Äúout-of-network‚Äù fees. That is pretty disgusting.
261,Sanders,The Republicans who are suppressing the vote are terrified of how we could transform this country when millions more Americans are allowed to participate in our democracy. They are cowards.
262,Sanders,"By stopping the U.S. support that Saudi Arabia needs to carry out its bombings in Yemen, we can help end the world‚Äôs worst humanitarian crisis. I've passed an awful lot of amendments in Congress over the years, so let me tell you: this one is"
263,Sanders,"I've never met a voter, Republican or Democrat, who is begging the government to let corporations pollute the sources we rely on for drinking water even more. Yet that's just what Trump is doing, threatening 117 million Americans. Big polluters are in charge of our government."
264,Sanders,"Workers of all backgrounds are standing up for their rights. That includes yoga teachers, who are facing down shameful anti-union propaganda from their Wall Street owners. This is exactly the kind of energy we need to rebuild the middle class."
265,Sanders,"It is unbelievable that this needs to be said: American citizens are not something to be ‚Äúcleaned up,‚Äù Mr. Trump.I have a much better idea. Build homes for all 552,730 unsheltered people, at a cost of less than 10% of Trump‚Äôs tax cut for the rich and large corporations."
266,Sanders,Now do AR-15s.
267,Sanders,Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply to be a full-time legislative intern in my D.C. office in the fall and spring semesters. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis.
268,Sanders,"Home health aides, mostly women of color, do enormous work caring for our elderly. Yet they are insanely overworked and get poverty pay. Almost half need public assistance. What they need are the living wages and benefits they are entitled to in America."
269,Sanders,"We must also reflect on the 18-year-old ""war on terror"" and the harm it has caused. If we do not move decisively to end America‚Äôs longest war, we will soon see servicemembers fight and die in Afghanistan and around the world in a conflict that was started before they were born."
270,Sanders,"This year, Congress finally acted to give these first responders the financial security and medical attention they need as they cope with illnesses from the toxins they were exposed to at Ground Zero."
271,Sanders,"Today, we remember the 3,000 Americans we lost on September 11, 2001, and we honor the bravery of the emergency workers who rushed into danger in order to save lives."
272,Sanders,96 percent of Democrats and 83 percent of Republicans support background checks for all potential gun buyers. The gun lobby should not control Congress.
273,Sanders,"This is what oligarchy looks like. If you're a member of the family that controls Cargill, you can award yourself a $5 million payout. Meanwhile, small farmers are struggling and Mitch McConnell is blocking a raise to $15 an hour for 40 million workers."
274,Sanders,"Mr. Trump lied. He promised to strengthen health care‚Äîinstead, he has done everything he can to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.The result: Nearly two million people joined the ranks of the uninsured last year, the first increase in the uninsured rate in a decade."
275,Sanders,It's absurd that the United States is the only advanced country that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation time. A mom and a dad ought to have the right to at least a couple of weeks of paid vacation so they can spend quality time with their kids.
276,Sanders,The DMV should not use its trove of personal information as a tool to make money. Nobody‚Äîfrom agencies like the DMV to large corporations like Facebook and Google‚Äîshould be profiting from sharing or selling personal information without meaningful consent.
277,Sanders,This is dangerous. Too many Americans have fought and died to defend American democracy to let President Trump act like an authoritarian.
278,Sanders,"Poverty is, in my view, a death sentence. The poorest older Americans die at twice the rate as the richest. We must end our country‚Äôs obscene inequality and ensure basic economic security for all‚Äîor we will condemn an entire generation to early death."
279,Sanders,"If @realDonaldTrump was serious about ending U.S. wars in the Middle East, he would‚Äôve signed our bipartisan bill to stop the Yemen war instead of vetoing it.If Congress does not stand up to him and defund it, the Saudi-led war could kill 233,000 Yemenis by the end of the year."
280,Sanders,"The world's largest military budgets: üáØüáµ $50 billionüá¨üáß $53 billionüá´üá∑ $56 billionüáÆüá≥ $58 billionüá∑üá∫ $63 billionüá∏üá¶ $83 billionüá®üá≥ $168 billionüá∫üá∏ $700 billion What if‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîwe led the world not in weapons and war, but in fighting humanity's common enemy: climate change?"
281,Sanders,"Here are 6 of the 10 fastest-growing jobs in America: ‚Ä¢ Personal care aide‚Äî$24,020‚Ä¢ Food preparer‚Äî$21,250‚Ä¢ Home health aide‚Äî$24,200‚Ä¢ Cook‚Äî$26,530‚Ä¢ Waiter‚Äî$21,780‚Ä¢ Janitor‚Äî$26,110If we want a decent, humane society, workers must get at least $15 an hour and a union."
282,Sanders,"Under a Medicare for All system, we are going to guarantee health care to all people as a human right. Working people should not have to search around for coupons or risk going into bankruptcy to afford their medical care."
283,Sanders,"How absurd is it that Social Security has lifted 22 million Americans out of poverty and is among the most popular government programs in existence, but Republicans still want to cut it? Sorry, GOP, but our job is not to cut Social Security. Our job is to expand it."
284,Sanders,Mr. Trump wasted everyone's time with ludicrous talk about trying to buy Greenland.Wouldn't it be nice if we had a leader who tried to stop it from melting?
285,Sanders,"Addiction is a disease, not criminal activity.Here's who should be held criminally liable: The top executives of the opioid manufacturers who lied by pushing a product they knew was addictive on doctors and patients, causing a national public health emergency."
286,Sanders,"Here's a fact you don't hear too often: Half of America‚Äôs workers make less than $19 an hour. When we double the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15, we'll boost pay up the income ladder. That means workers making above $15 an hour‚Äî11.6 million of them‚Äîwill also get raises."
287,Sanders,"The loan sharks of today wear expensive suits and work on Wall Street, where they make hundreds of millions of dollars by pushing sky-high fees and outrageous interest rates as high as 27 percent on American consumers. Together, we must end their greed."
288,Sanders,"Trump's still trying to waste billions of taxpayer dollars on a wall, using a phony ""national emergency"" to ignore Congress and the Constitution. Think of the urgent work we could be doing together, instead, if we treated climate change like the national emergency that it is."
289,Sanders,"Just in time for the new school year, billionaire Betsy DeVos wants to make it harder for students who were the victims of fraud to get their debts cancelled. She has got to be the worst Secretary of Education in the modern history of our country."
290,Sanders,"The fossil fuel industry is now the equivalent of the tobacco industry. It creates death and destruction, then spends billions denying its responsibility. Let us be clear: Hurricane Dorian has everything to do with climate change, which is the existential crisis of our time."
291,Sanders,Bipartisan majorities of Congress told Mr. Trump to end this unconstitutional war. Now we must use Congress‚Äôs power of the purse to block every nickel of taxpayer money from going to help the Saudi dictatorship as it bombs and starves civilians in Yemen.
292,Sanders,"If you were born in 1973, the median wage went from $17 to $19 an hour over your lifetime. That‚Äôs it. Two bucks in 45 years. The top 1%'s annual income tripled: $480K to $1.45 million.That's why we need a political revolution. To build an economy for all of us‚Äînot the 1%."
293,Sanders,"Eight million people work two or more jobs just to survive in the world's richest country. Their stories show us an economy of, by, and for the 1%.It's time to stand up, fight back, and build a society where America's working class can live in dignity."
294,Sanders,"This Labor Day, I stand with my House colleagues. Mitch McConnell: You do not have the right to deprive the American people of a debate to give millions of workers a raise. Bring the Raise The Wage Act to the floor for a vote."
295,Sanders,"U.S. bombs, logistical support, and intelligence for the Saudi dictatorship's airstrikes make us complicit in this nightmare.Congress has declared this war unconstitutional. We must now stand up to Trump and defund all U.S. involvement in these horrors."
296,Sanders,"Even the part of Trump‚Äôs tax scam supposedly for low-income neighborhoods is a massive tax avoidance scheme for the ultra-rich. President Trump has many critics. But as a con artist, he is a talent of the highest caliber."
297,Sanders,"Average cost of a year of college: $50,000Median family income: $61,000We let middle-class parents drown in debt trying to ensure a middle-class future for their kids. That is obscene.We must cancel student debt and make public colleges tuition-free."
298,Sanders,It is unconscionable that this man was given a lifetime prison sentence and kept behind bars for 36 years‚Äîfor stealing $50 at the age of 22.We have a racist criminal justice system that must be fundamentally transformed.
299,Sanders,"How crazy is it that there was no in-state tuition for all students in California, until the 1970s? College was free.Not crazy at all. Don't let anyone tell you that we cannot tax Wall Street to fund tuition-free college and the cancellation of student debt."
300,Sanders,"Strong unions are the reason why America once led the world in wages in benefits. No wonder they're so popular, despite decades of right-wing attacks. We must rebuild the trade union movement in this country."
301,Sanders,Good. Now let's do every other state and territory in the country.
302,Sanders,"It is crazy that we are the only country that lets drug companies charge anything they want‚Äîeven $6 million‚Äîand raise the price tomorrow.Taxpayers give Big Pharma patent monopolies, tax breaks and research money. But Medicare isn't allowed to negotiate fair prices. Shameful."
303,Sanders,"The Amazon is being destroyed. So Trump opens America's largest rainforest, Tongass National Forest, to logging and mining. Methane emissions surge worldwide. Trump's EPA will make them grow faster.The president and his billionaire friends are a threat to our entire planet."
304,Sanders,What does it mean when the function of the health care system‚Äîin the richest country in the history of the world‚Äîis to make billions for insurance and drug companies? 18 percent of Americans with diabetes are rationing the medications they need to live.
305,Sanders,"On Trump's watch, 3,000 Americans died after Hurricane Mar√≠a. A new storm approaches and 33,000 Puerto Ricans still live under blue tarps. Trump's response? Divert $155 million from FEMA for migrant detention, complain about federal aid, and mock Puerto Rican officials. Insane."
306,Sanders,"Debido al fracaso del gobierno federal, 33, 000 techos todav√≠a siguen con toldos azules despu√©s del hurac√°n Mar√≠a, que fue hace casi 2 a√±os. El gobierno federal debe proveer todos los recursos, por el tiempo que sea necesario, para preparar a nuestros conciudadanos para lo peor."
307,Sanders,"Due to the failure of the federal government, 33,000 roofs still have blue tarps almost two years after Hurricane Mar√≠a. We must commit full resources to prepare our fellow citizens for the worst and stand with them for as long as is necessary to finally help rebuild Puerto Rico."
308,Sanders,"Under the so-called ""War on Drugs,"" men on street corners dealing pot were thrown in jail. I want to see a war on the corporate greed that is killing Americans. I want to see top executives held personally liable for actions that led to the deaths of more than 42,000 people."
309,Sanders,"Under my legislation, the Opioid Crisis Accountability Act, Johnson &amp; Johnson would be fined $7.8 billion‚Äî13 times as much as this penalty, about half of the company's profits, and 10 percent of the total annual cost of the terrible opioid crisis afflicting our country."
310,Sanders,"This fine is a step in the right direction. But I want to see the corporate executives at Johnson &amp; Johnson, Purdue, and other companies held criminally liable for their actions."
311,Sanders,"Trump complains about ""bad"" trade negotiators. But U.S. negotiators under both parties deliberately pushed through trade deals written by huge corporations designed to outsource millions of U.S. jobs and exploit cheap labor. We need fair trade to protect workers and our planet."
312,Sanders,People say climate action is expensive. But the price of inaction is far more costly. Intense heat waves could kill tens of thousands of Americans each year if we don't act. We must move urgently and boldly to transform our energy system.
313,Sanders,"If its CEO @SteveEasterbrk gets paid $85 million over three years, @McDonalds can damn well pay all its workers at least $15 an hour. @McDonaldsCorp market value grew $71 billion while it paid the average cashier a starvation wage of $9 an hour. Shameful."
314,Sanders,"Trains from Boston to D.C. take 7-8 hours. Trains from Beijing to Shanghai go nearly twice as far in half the time. A Green New Deal means major public investments in American-made high-speed rail. We can lower emissions, create good union jobs, and improve our quality of life."
315,Sanders,"Trump said he wanted to get us out of Middle East conflicts. He lied. When we passed a bill to end U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, he vetoed it. Congress must now defund all U.S. support for this war. Millions of lives are at stake."
316,Sanders,"Over 40 years, income per person doubled. But half our people live paycheck to paycheck. Why?Because the top 1% captured 45% of new income. And the median hourly wage grew by $2 over 40 years.This is a rigged economy. And the working class needs to come together to fix it."
317,Sanders,Let's be clear: Trickle-down economics is nothing but a fraudulent theory designed by the rich and their think tanks to protect billionaires and large corporations.
318,Sanders,"The inaction and denialism of Trump and Bolsonaro are threatening not just our lives, but also future generations. Americans and Brazilians must come together to defeat these rightwing demagogues and act immediately to save the planet‚Äîour only home‚Äîfrom climate catastrophe."
319,Sanders,"The banks are still at it. This is the very same Wall Street recklessness that led to economic disaster and ruined millions of lives across our country. Unless we end their greed, American taxpayers will be on the hook again."
320,Sanders,"Black women make 61 cents on the dollar compared to white men, and their wages continue to fall further and further behind. That is simply a disgrace.We should guarantee equal pay for equal work. This is not a radical idea‚Äîthis is an issue of basic justice."
321,Sanders,"It will take student borrowers 100 years to repay their debt for the ""crime"" of getting a higher education. That is insane.We have got to hit the reset button. We should cancel all student debt in this country and make Wall Street pay for it."
322,Sanders,"For centuries, America‚Äôs rise relied on treating Black people as literal property. ""Slavery By Another Name"" continued well into the 20th century. I believe we should talk about this part of our history, and learn about how it has shaped every aspect of our politics and economy."
323,Sanders,"If the richest Americans do not start paying their fair share of taxes, we are headed for a future where they control all of the wealth and the rest of the country has none. All of it.To me, that is outrageous and that is not what America is about."
324,Sanders,"On many issues, we are divided, but comprehensive background checks are supported by 97 percent of Americans. President Trump is a coward whose failure to act threatens public safety."
325,Sanders,"The business model of Wells Fargo is fraud. Yet how many people at Wells Fargo are going to jail? Zero.But if you smoke marijuana in this country, you get a criminal record. That is unacceptable."
326,Sanders,"We still can't import medicine from Canada at a fraction of the price. My bill, the Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act, ends this absurdity. We can lower drug prices and save lives. Does @realDonaldTrump have the guts to stand up to Big Pharma‚Äôs greed?"
327,Sanders,"CEOs of billion-dollar companies say they want to invest in their workers and communities. Good. I have a few ideas for them:‚úÖ Provide a living wage of at least $15 an hour‚úÖ Stop union-busting and outsourcing jobs‚úÖ Pay your taxes, don't evade them"
328,Sanders,Trump and the Republicans' latest attack on women's rights is this gag rule on health providers. Their goal is to overturn Roe v. Wade.We will not let them win. We must fight together until a woman‚Äôs constitutional right to abortion is truly secure.
329,Sanders,The millennial generation was told that the only way they would get good jobs is if they received a college education. That turned out to be dead wrong. Wages for the average college graduate have stagnated. It's time to hit the reset button. Here's how:
330,Sanders,"Together, we will cancel all student debt. And we're going to make Wall Street speculators pay for every nickel of it."
331,Sanders,"Whether America's climate-action plan is 1,000 pages long or two pages long, at the end of the day, we all know what it‚Äôs about. It‚Äôs about building the political power to tell the fossil fuel industry: Sorry, you cannot continue to destroy the planet for short-term profits."
332,Sanders,"Billionaires and huge corporations should not be allowed to use loopholes and tax havens to avoid paying their fair share. At a time of massive global inequality the very wealthy should be paying more in taxes, not less."
333,Sanders,"Some say we can't afford tuition-free public college. Let me get this straight: 40 years ago, in an economy with half the income per person, some of the best public schools were essentially free. But guaranteeing college for all is so ""radical"" that we can't afford it today?"
334,Sanders,"President Trump proposed cutting Social Security benefits by $25 billion in his budget. That should outrage all of us, young and old alike. No, Mr. President, we will not let you cut Social Security. We will fight to expand it."
335,Sanders,"Think of how crazy you have to be, in the middle of a mass-extinction event, to try to destroy the Endangered Species Act.I‚Äôm sure Trump‚Äôs friends in the fossil fuel and mineral industries are happy with his attack on our biodiversity."
336,Sanders,"Over 40 years:‚Ä¢ GDP per person doubled‚Ä¢ CEO pay ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1,000%‚Ä¢ CEOs, who got $30 for every $1 a worker made, now get $278‚Ä¢ The median wage grew $2 an hour since 1978A political revolution means standing up to billionaires to say: Enough is enough. You can't have it all."
337,Sanders,"If Prime Minister @Netanyahu doesn't want members of Congress to visit Israel, then maybe he can respectfully decline $3.8 billion in annual funding‚Äîthe largest amount of U.S. aid to any country.I believe in an even-handed approach to ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
338,Sanders,It's confirmed: July was the hottest month ever recorded. How insane is it that our Environmental Protection Agency is now run by a former coal lobbyist? We must stand up to the fossil fuel industry and say: you will no longer dictate our climate policy.
339,Sanders,"No senior should have to sell their belongings or spend their life savings just to be able to age in place. Under the Medicare for All, long-term, home-based care will be guaranteed as a right to every senior and person with a disability in America."
340,Sanders,"Banning Congresswomen Omar and Tlaib from entering Israel and Palestine is a sign of enormous disrespect to these elected leaders, to the United States Congress, and to the principles of democracy. The Israeli government should reverse this decision and allow them in."
341,Sanders,"When @RepCummings and I asked pharma CEOs about soaring drug prices, they coordinated to block our investigation.@MylanNews and @TevaUSA: Obstructing our inquiry is a crime. The American people deserve answers about your price-fixing conspiracy."
342,Sanders,Mr. Trump is a lying bigot.
343,Sanders,"On this day, 84 years ago, FDR signed Social Security into law. It is one of the most successful programs in our country‚Äôs history and lifts more Americans out of poverty than any other. We are not going to cut Social Security‚Äîwe are going to expand it."
344,Sanders,"The effects of climate change already affect all of us‚Äîrural and urban residents, inland and coastal communities alike.Let's come together as a nation and mobilize a response as large and serious as the emergency itself. Our future depends on it."
345,Sanders,Do you think it‚Äôs a coincidence that the racist manifesto of the El Paso shooter echoes Trump‚Äôs language of ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù and ‚Äúinfestation‚Äù of immigrants? I don‚Äôt. @realDonaldTrump is fanning the flames of white supremacy. We must stop him.
346,Sanders,The United States needs to end the international embarrassment of being the only industrialized nation not to provide paid family leave.
347,Sanders,"We must not be about tearing small children away from their families. In 2002, I voted against creation of DHS and the establishment of ICE. That was the right vote. What our cruel and broken immigration system needs is comprehensive reform."
348,Sanders,"$70,000 a minute. $4 million per hour. $100 million per day. That's how much the Walton family, the richest family in the world, made last year. I say to the Walton family: No more excuses. Pay your workers a living wage‚Äîat least $15 an hour."
349,Sanders,"I guess this is what Senator Mitch McConnell calls ""leadership"": Defending starvation wages for American workers, inaction on the climate crisis, and doing nothing to stop mass shootings."
350,Sanders,"Health care is a right, not a privilege. We need Medicare for All so we can end the disgrace of 30 million Americans having no health insurance, and many more being underinsured with high deductibles and co-payments."
351,Sanders,"Our grassroots movement got Democrats and Republicans to pass our bill to end the U.S. role in Saudi Arabia's brutal war in Yemen. Although Trump vetoed it, Congress can still rein in this president and put an end to the world's worst humanitarian crisis."
352,Sanders,"Billionaire Wall Street investors think they‚Äôre pretty savvy. But their big bet on fossil fuels didn‚Äôt pan out: BlackRock lost $90 billion investing in oil and coal over 10 years. Maybe after a few billion more in losses, they‚Äôll realize we should act to solve climate change."
353,Sanders,"Prescription drug costs are too damn high!For decades, we've been paying more to pharmaceutical companies than any other country. You know what that makes us? The suckers of the world."
354,Sanders,"In 1923, researchers who discovered insulin sold the patent for $1 so it would be available to all. But drug companies hijacked this lifesaving medicine and now charge over $300 a vial. Let‚Äôs be clear about this: Big Pharma‚Äôs greed is literally killing people in this country."
355,Sanders,"The Trump plan to cut nutrition assistance for 3 million Americans is nothing short of obscene. Tax cuts for the rich, more hunger for the poor. This is what oligarchy looks like.We are calling on @realDonaldTrump to reverse this disastrous proposal."
356,Sanders,"Billions around the world are at risk of drought, displacement, and resource wars. What if, instead of spending $738 billion a year on the Pentagon and weapons systems, the United States brought the world together to cooperate on solving climate change?"
357,Sanders,"And we should make public colleges and universities tuition-free. This is not a ""radical"" idea. Here is how we do it:"
358,Sanders,We should cancel it.
359,Sanders,July 2019 was the hottest month in recorded history. Make no mistake: this is an emergency. We cannot afford to simply wait Trump out. Congress must act boldly to tackle the climate threat‚Äîthe fate of our children and grandchildren depend on it.
360,Sanders,"Why are we the only advanced country with no guaranteed family leave, sick days or vacations? Because corporate America hates unions. Our plan, the Workplace Democracy Act, will revitalize union organizing so America's working class has a dignified life."
361,Sanders,"President Trump faces a choice: bring the country together to pass commonsense gun safety measures‚Äîor blame the internet. He has decided to side with the NRA, whose lobbyists and campaign contributions control the Republican party. #VideogamesAreNotToBlame"
362,Sanders,"On the issue of guns, we are not so divided: Over 90% of the public supports universal background checks.  @SenateGOP and @realDonaldTrump: the country is demanding action right now. Will you side with the American people or will you just do what the @NRA wants?"
363,Sanders,"No one should profit from imprisoning people, especially children.We must end this morally repugnant business."
364,Sanders,"Senator McConnell, bring a bill to fight this gun violence epidemic to the Senate floor for a vote. These were passed by the House five months ago: ‚àô Bipartisan Background Checks Act ‚àô Enhanced Background Checks ActWithout action, your words are meaningless and insulting."
365,Sanders,"A society which proclaims freedom as its goal, as the United States does, must work unceasingly to end the disgraceful bigotry and violence against transgender Americans."
366,Sanders,"El pueblo boricua se uni√≥, se levant√≥, y le forz√≥ a Rossell√≥ a renunciar. Nos muestra lo que la gente com√∫n puede lograr cuando nos organizamos. Ahora tenemos que asegurar de que reciban una representaci√≥n justa y receptiva. Puerto Rico se merece la democracia, no la austeridad."
367,Sanders,"The Puerto Rican people came together, stood up, and forced Governor Rossell√≥ to resign. They showed us what ordinary people can achieve when we organize. Our job now is to make sure they get fair and responsive representation. Puerto Rico deserves democracy, not austerity."
368,Sanders,I say to Mitch McConnell: Do not ignore the will of 200 million Americans who want us to put an end to starvation wages in the United States.Let the American people have a vote on a $15 minimum wage!
369,Sanders,"The pharmaceutical industry will claim the outrageous prices they charge for life-saving medicines are necessary. Maybe they haven‚Äôt heard of a country that we share thousands of miles of a border with, where they sell the exact same drugs for a fraction of the price."
370,Sanders,Esto es inaceptable. El gobierno de los Estados Unidos le ha fallado al pueblo de Puerto Rico por demasiado tiempo. Eso debe acabar ya. El presidente Trump debe asegurar que el gobierno federal est√© haciendo todo lo que est√© en su poder para reconstruir a Puerto Rico.
371,Sanders,"For far too long, the U.S. government has failed the people of Puerto Rico. That must end today. President Trump must act now to ensure that the federal government is doing everything in its power to fully rebuild Puerto Rico."
372,Sanders,"The Pentagon is set to grow by $90 billion and reach $738 billion next year. For $90 billion, we could double nutrition assistance or provide $7,000 to every child in poverty. We cannot keep handing over billions to the military-industrial complex."
373,Sanders,"We should pay attention to this: Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right authoritarian, is rapidly destroying the Amazon rainforest. He is a threat to working people, minorities, journalists, and a habitable planet. No wonder Trump loves him so much."
374,Sanders,"If every major country on the planet can guarantee health care to all and achieve better health outcomes, while spending less per capita, please do not tell us that the United States of America cannot do the same."
375,Sanders,"This is what an energy transition looks like when we have no plan. The coal company Blackjewel has filed for bankruptcy‚Äîmeanwhile, its miners have not been paid for weeks. We need to move to a sustainable economy with a just and fair transition for workers and their families."
376,Sanders,"To restore our one-person-one-vote democracy, we must pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and stop this country's slide to oligarchy."
377,Sanders,"It makes no sense for young people to be denied jobs because they were arrested for smoking marijuana. It is time to decriminalize marijuana, expunge past marijuana convictions and end the failed war on drugs."
378,Sanders,The Saudis said Jamal Khashoggi‚Äôs murder was a ‚Äòrogue operation.‚Äô That was a lie. A new piece reveals the regime‚Äôs ongoing efforts to harass and kidnap its critics around the world. It's past time to rethink our relationship with this repressive regime.
379,Sanders,"I wonder why Donald Trump vetoed our historic legislation to end U.S. involvement in the brutal bombing of Yemen. Who benefits from that?Raytheon, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and General Dynamics: the four corporations making 90 percent of the weapons that we sell to Saudi Arabia."
380,Sanders,"It is unacceptable that across every chronic and acute health condition, people of color fare worse than their white counterparts. Together, we can fight racial bias and repair our broken health care system by passing the Health Equity and Accountability Act and Medicare for All."
381,Sanders,"Let us be clear: In states where they have increased the minimum wage, paychecks are higher and the economy is booming. There is no excuse not to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and end starvation wages for 40 million Americans."
382,Sanders,"Public support for Medicare for All is rising. Why? The reason is pretty obvious. It is getting harder and harder to defend a dysfunctional health care system in which 30,000 people die every year because they don't get to a doctor when they should."
383,Sanders,"How crazy is this? Even though car makers agreed with California to keep stronger fuel efficiency standards, the EPA is proposing to allow more tailpipe pollution. Trump's loyalty to the fossil fuel industry is threatening the very lives of our children."
384,Sanders,"The climate crisis means more frequent and more intense heatwaves around the world. Our job must be to rapidly transform our energy system from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. With a Green New Deal, we can save the planet and create millions of new jobs."
385,Sanders,"I agree with @Ilhan. We must counter Trump's racist playbook by advancing policies that unmistakably improve working people‚Äôs lives, like strengthening collective bargaining, raising the minimum wage, and treating jobs and health care as human rights."
386,Sanders,"For three decades, I have been advocating for tuition-free college. If you are new to this effort, we welcome you to the fight for justice."
387,Sanders,".@RepRaulGrijalva is right. We must stand with the people of Puerto Rico in this decisive moment, and make sure their will is not trampled upon by an unelected board making cuts to education and health care."
388,Sanders,"Our broken criminal justice system targets poor people and minorities disproportionately with the death penalty, including those who are innocent. The government should not be in the business of killing people. We must abolish capital punishment."
389,Sanders,"Nobody should be ""drowning,"" worrying about becoming homeless, because of crushing student debt in the United States of America.It is time to tax Wall Street to fund student debt cancellation and tuition-free public colleges for all."
390,Sanders,The president‚Äôs veto enables the sale of $8.1 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia's brutal dictators. It will deepen and prolong the world's worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen. It infringes on Congress' authority over matters of war.What a disgrace.
391,Sanders,"Esta persona debe ayudar a la isla a recuperarse luego de d√©cadas de devastaci√≥n econ√≥mica y del hurac√°n Mar√≠a, que arras√≥ la isla hace casi dos a√±os. Sin demora, garantizaremos el apoyo total del gobierno federal en la reconstrucci√≥n y recuperaci√≥n de Puerto Rico."
392,Sanders,"Felicito a los milliones de boricuas que se unieron a exigir que el gobernador Rossell√≥ renunciara. Cuando nos unimos, no hay nada que no podemos lograr. La pr√≥xima persona que gobierne la isla debe escuchar a la gente y oponerse a la corrupci√≥n y la austeridad de Wall Street."
393,Sanders,"His successor must stand against corruption and Wall Street-imposed austerity to help the island recover from decades of economic devastation and Hurricane Maria. Together, we will ensure the full support of the federal government in the rebuilding and recovery of Puerto Rico."
394,Sanders,"I congratulate the millions of people in Puerto Rico who came together to demand the resignation of Governor Rossell√≥.When we stand together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish."
395,Sanders,"Why is it that year after year, our people are living shorter lives while we spend more and more on health care?Pharmaceutical profits are a big part of the story. If we want to solve the opioid crisis, their greed and criminality must come to an end."
396,Sanders,Trump is a scam artist and a demagogue. He is using racism to divide working people and distract from his loyalty to billionaires and huge corporations. It won't work. The American people will come together and defeat this strategy of fomenting hate.
397,Sanders,"Trump proposed $87 billion in cuts to infrastructure over the next 10 years in his budget. How is it, Mr. President, that a nation can thrive when its infrastructure is crumbling?"
398,Sanders,"This proposal belongs in the trash, @realDonaldTrump. No one should go hungry in the United States of America."
399,Sanders,"If we could bail out Wall Street and give $1.5 trillion in tax breaks to private corporations, we damn well can cancel all student debt in this country‚Äîno exceptions."
400,Sanders,"@Ilhan @RepJayapal @rweingarten @AFTunion Here's our plan to make all public colleges, trade schools and universities tuition free, and eliminate all student debt while making Wall Street speculators pay for every penny of it:"
401,Sanders,"Teachers are facing outrageous levels of student debt. It is time to cancel student debt for all and make public universities and colleges tuition-free. @Ilhan, @RepJayapal and I are incredibly proud to have the support of @rweingarten and @AFTUnion in this effort. #CollegeforAll"
402,Sanders,"Hundreds of thousands of people in Puerto Rico are demonstrating against corruption, Wall Street-imposed austerity, and decades of economic devastation. We stand with them: Governor Rossello must resign. Puerto Rico needs new leadership and a new direction."
403,Sanders,"Big Pharma lied about opioid addictiveness. And here they are, joking about their racket in these emails. Their greed has no limits. We must pass the Opioid Crisis Accountability Act to hold top executives criminally liable for the devastation they caused."
404,Sanders,"Does Donald Trump want a war with Iran? Who knows? Nobody in the world knows what they'll do tomorrow. And given the confusion in this administration, it‚Äôs possible they may. But this I do know: The United States Congress must do everything it can to prevent this war."
405,Sanders,"Me uno al reclamo del pueblo boricua, que ha salido a la calle en un #ParoNacional, para exigir la renuncia inmediata del gobernador Ricardo Rossell√≥. Debemos garantizar el apoyo del gobierno federal en los esfuerzos de reconstrucci√≥n y recuperaci√≥n de Puerto Rico."
406,Sanders,"I stand with the people of Puerto Rico, who have taken to the streets for a national strike, to demand the immediate resignation of Governor Rossell√≥. We must ensure the full support of the federal government in the rebuilding and recovery of Puerto Rico."
407,Sanders,"Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have all seen their tax rates go from 30 to 22 percent thanks to Trump's tax scam. Our job: repeal it and tax Wall Street to cancel $1.6 trillion in student debt."
408,Sanders,"How is it that in the richest country in the history of the world, we can't afford to pay everyone a living wage? Until we raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, I'm going to keep asking."
409,Sanders,"You want good, clean teeth? Simple: Brush your teeth, floss, and fight for Medicare for All."
410,Sanders,The window for meaningful climate action is closing. Our job: come together to take on the powerful fossil fuel industry and mobilize a national response as large and serious as the emergency itself. Our future depends on it.
411,Sanders,"Me uno al reclamo del pueblo boricua que sali√≥ a la calle a exigir la rendici√≥n de cuentas por parte del gobernador y el fin de la corrupci√≥n. Ante los huracanes y 10 a√±os de austeridad, los boricuas tienen derecho a la democracia y a todo el apoyo federal para salir de la crisis"
412,Sanders,"‚ö†Ô∏èThe past 5 years are the hottest on record‚ö†Ô∏èThis June is the hottest June recorded‚ö†Ô∏èThousands die in heatwaves around the worldTrump's ignorance is threatening the lives of our children. For their sake, we must stand up to the fossil fuel industry and build a green economy."
413,Sanders,"Mitch McConnell is wrong. Since 1979, when a state has increased the min. wage, employment and wages typically go up, not down. A $15 minimum wage would raise wages for 39 million people and lift millions of Americans out of poverty. Why is McConnell afraid to let us vote on it?"
414,Sanders,"I stand with the people of Puerto Rico taking to the streets to demand accountability for the governor and an end to corruption.After dealing with hurricanes and a decade of austerity, Puerto Ricans have a right to democracy and full federal support to get out of this crisis."
415,Sanders,"Four years ago, @KeithEllison and I rallied with low wage workers for an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.We were laughed at. We were told it was unrealistic. We were told it wouldn't happen. Not anymore."
416,Sanders,"After supporting a huge increase in military spending for the most dangerous president in American history, it would be outrageous for the House to approve a bill that would deny primary care to over 3 million Americans by cutting community health centers by 20% in real dollars."
417,Sanders,"Remember when $15 an hour was ""radical""? Not so radical anymore thanks to people fighting for a living wage. In a historic vote today, the House of Representatives will pass legislation to end poverty wages for 33 million people."
418,Sanders,#IStandWithIlhan and am proud to work with her in Congress. Trump is stoking the most despicable and disturbing currents in our society. And that very hatred and racism fuels him. We must fight together to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of our country.
419,Sanders,"Exactly 50 years after the moon landing, we can again mobilize as a nation to overcome enormous challenges. We have no time to waste in taking on climate change, which is a true national emergency. Here's how @repblumenauer and I plan to tackle it:"
420,Sanders,Not one major Wall Street executive went to jail for destroying the American economy. The criminal justice system is profoundly broken.
421,Sanders,"@aylaa_renee @hacketmale @SenatorLeahy @WelchForVT We are having a ""milk toast,"" the finest beverage of the great state of Vermont."
422,Sanders,"I congratulate my friend @SenatorLeahy for casting his 16,000th vote in the U.S. Senate! Senator Leahy has worked tirelessly for the people of Vermont since 1974, bringing our state's values of justice and openness to Washington. I look forward to continuing our work together."
423,Sanders,"""A democracy cannot function effectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold."" This was Justice John Paul Stevens‚Äô prophetic dissent against Citizens United. During his tenure on the Supreme Court, he was astute and fair. We will miss him."
424,Sanders,"One might have thought given all the Republicans in the House and Senate, a vast number would be standing up and saying the president's racist comments do not reflect the views of their party. It is sad and disappointing the degree to which Trump's ideology has dominated the GOP."
425,Sanders,"I am not interested in a photo op at an Amazon warehouse. I am calling for Labor Department inspectors to come in, unannounced, and do thorough investigations of the facilities where hundreds of workers have told me about horrendous conditions and abuse."
426,Sanders,@halrudnick I must admit that today I felt the burn.
427,Sanders,"The grassroots of our country came together and got the Congress to pass a bipartisan prohibition on unconstitutional war with Iran. Given the recklessness of this administration, I intend to do everything I can in the Senate to get this passed. No war with Iran!"
428,Sanders,"Amazon #PrimeDay sales are nice, but not if they come at the expense of worker safety. The Department of Labor must #InvestigateAmazon."
429,Sanders,"I believe, with @IlhanMN and my colleagues, that a complete investigation by @OSHA_DOL into Amazon warehouses is long overdue. The reports of dangerous, dehumanizing conditions‚Äîwhere 125,000 Americans are working for the wealthiest man in the history of the world‚Äîare sickening."
430,Sanders,Climate change is an existential disaster facing the entire world. We should start acting like it.
431,Sanders,I stand in solidarity with the courageous Amazon workers engaging in a work stoppage against unconscionable working conditions in their warehouses. It is not too much to ask that a company owned by the wealthiest person in the world treat its workers with dignity and respect.
432,Sanders,"This is how we defeat Donald Trump's disgraceful bigotry and xenophobia. When billionaires use racism to divide us, we build solidarity among working people‚Äîimmigrants and non-immigrants, gay and straight, men and women, black and brown and white."
433,Sanders,"The American people are sick and tired of a president who is a liar, a fraud, a narcissist and a bully, @realDonaldTrump. They want leadership which unites us, not divides us."
434,Sanders,"We must oppose Mr. Trump's nightmarish mass-deportation plans. We must stop family separation, reunite families that have been separated, and eliminate private detention facilities. Know your rights. Conozca sus derechos."
435,Sanders,The time is long overdue for comprehensive and humane reform of our immigration system. These members of Congress went to the Southern border to go inside detention facilities operated by the Trump administration. What they saw horrified them.
436,Sanders,Appalachians deal with dirty air and water because of the coal industry's greed. They are standing up and fighting back. @NRDems and I are committed to working with these communities to build just and healthy local economies as we tackle the climate
437,Sanders,"Throughout our history, the Postal Service and its unions have been vital institutions providing a pathway into the middle class for working families, particularly communities of color. I stand with @mrdannyglover: we will not allow @USPS to be privatized."
438,Sanders,"Alex Acosta should never have been nominated as Labor Secretary. Now is the time to put an end to our two-tiered criminal justice system. We need a Labor Secretary who puts workers first, not billionaires‚Äîand certainly not billionaire sexual predators of underage girls."
439,Sanders,Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt give a damn about the working people of America. His singular aim is to help his billionaire friends make as much money as possible. We need to take on the pharmaceutical industry whose greed is killing Americans and lower the price of medicine in half.
440,Sanders,This is what strong oversight is about. The House is reclaiming its authority over war and blocking U.S. tax dollars from going to Saudi bombings in Yemen. Today's vote should make Donald Trump take a hard look at the despotic regime he loves so much.
441,Sanders,"I applaud the House of Representatives for voting to end all U.S. participation in the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. Congress has the power to end this brutal, unconstitutional military intervention. I will do everything in my power in the Senate to see that it becomes law."
442,Sanders,"Congratulations to the University of Texas for expanding access to tuition-free college! This is a step in the right direction. Our plan: tax Wall Street, raise $2.4 trillion, cancel student debt, and eliminate tuition at every public college and university for all students."
443,Sanders,You can call me a lot of things but you cannot call me inconsistent. Our country must join every other major nation of the world and guarantee health care as a human right. I hope we are not going to keep debating this for another 50 years. #MedicareforAll
444,Sanders,I agree with Senator Cruz. Congress already blocked weapons sales to the authoritarian regime of Saudi Arabia. Mr. President: follow the damn law.
445,Sanders,"These incredible high schoolers are working to stop the unconstitutional U.S.-Saudi war in Yemen. They know Congress has the power of the purse. A new effort by @RepRoKhanna, @RepAdamSchiff, @RepAdamSmith and @RepJayapal will defund Trump's participation in this brutal conflict."
446,Sanders,"Climate disasters that can cause death, displacement and suffering‚Äîunprecedented heatwaves, storms, and flooding‚Äînow occur at a rate of one per week. If that is not an emergency, I don't know what is."
447,Sanders,Happy #CowAppreciationDay.
448,Sanders,Republicans are still trying to eliminate the Affordable Care Act. They couldn't do it through Congress because the American people rose up. Now they are going through the courts. Our job: keep up the pressure and stop them from kicking millions of people off their health care.
449,Sanders,"After the Pearl Harbor attacks, America came together and in three years mobilized for victory in World War II. Today, Congress must lead a national mobilization to take on the fossil fuel industry, transform our economy, and defeat a climate emergency."
450,Sanders,"Ross Perot was a champion for veterans' rights and ahead of his time on disastrous trade policies. During his campaign, he explained, in depth, how he would address our national problems and spurred serious discussion. Ross Perot was a one-of-a kind American. He will be missed."
451,Sanders,"I am proud to stand with @AOC and @repblumenauer today to announce our resolution declaring a climate emergency. If Trump insists on denying the reality of climate change, Congress must act to mobilize America and defeat this existential threat."
452,Sanders,"Every time a minimum wage increase has been proposed, the extreme right wing and their billionaire campaign contributors claim that jobs will be destroyed. They have been proven dead wrong. It is time to raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour."
453,Sanders,"President Trump‚Äôs record on the environment is pathetic and an embarrassment to the world. This is a man who still thinks climate change is a ""hoax."" He better start listening to scientists and not his friends in the fossil fuel, chemical, and big agribusiness industries."
454,Sanders,"In the richest country in the history of the world, no one should be living in poverty. It‚Äôs time to raise the current starvation level minimum wage to a living wage. It's time for Congress to pass the Raise the Wage Act to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour."
455,Sanders,"The United States is the wealthiest country on earth. Our parents and our children deserve paid parental leave. If every other major country can do it, why can't we?"
456,Sanders,"We spend less than 2.5% of our gross domestic product each year on infrastructure, while Europe spends double that rate and China four times as much.Why do we spend trillions on never ending wars but can't afford to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure?"
457,Sanders,"Millions of people are raising money on GoFundMe right now to fund their health care and life-saving medication. To my mind, that is not a functioning health care system. We must pass Medicare for All."
458,Sanders,Let‚Äôs cancel $1.6 trillion in student debt and make public universities tuition-free instead.
459,Sanders,"It was 115 degrees Fahrenheit in France last week ‚Äì the highest temperature they have ever recorded. Still think climate change is a hoax, @realDonaldTrump? You are"
460,Sanders,Wishing you and your loved ones a very safe and happy 4th of July.
461,Sanders,"I‚Äôm sure this will come as a big surprise to you: Trump‚Äôs phony rhetoric did nothing to stop skyrocketing drug prices. We need a president who will stand up to the greed of Big Pharma instead of appointing a pharma CEO to ""oversee"" that very industry."
462,Sanders,"This is what authoritarians do: @realDonaldTrump is taking $2.5 million away from our National Park Service to glorify himself with a spectacle of military tanks rolling through Washington. And top GOP donors are getting VIP seats, all at taxpayer expense."
463,Sanders,"Here is what we need to do: Convene the countries of this hemisphere to address the violence and deprivation that is prompting people to flee their own countries. As neighbors, we can solve these problems together."
464,Sanders,"We must stop family separation; reunite families that have been separated; end detention of families, children and anyone who doesn't pose a danger; eliminate private detention facilities; and protect asylum seekers. We also must oppose Trump's nightmarish mass-deportation plans."
465,Sanders,Racist and sexist behavior on the part of those who wear a uniform of the United States is completely unacceptable.@DHSgov must investigate and take strong action against those found guilty of this vulgar behavior.
466,Sanders,"Make no mistake: this is a major victory for democracy and a defeat for the xenophobic Trump Administration. The Census is supposed to count everyone, including immigrants. When we stand together and fight back, we can defeat Trump's bigotry."
467,Sanders,"Over the last decade, workers‚Äô wages barely kept up with inflation, while the number of billionaires in the United States more than doubled. The top 1% owns more wealth now than before the 2008 financial crash. This is what a rigged economy looks like:"
468,Sanders,Racist and sexist behavior on the part of those who wear a uniform of the United States is unacceptable. The DHS must investigate and take strong action against those found guilty of this vulgar behavior.
469,Sanders,"This is the point of canceling student debt and providing free college for all. Education should be treated as a public right, enjoyed by everyone‚Äînot a luxury afforded to the few."
470,Sanders,"Trump promised he would stop big drug companies from ""getting away with murder."" He lied.My bill with @RepRoKhanna stops Big Pharma's greed by cutting prescription drug prices in half so that Americans no longer pay the highest prices in the world."
471,Sanders,"I have no problem with Trump negotiating with Kim Jong Un. But while he's meeting with Kim, he's pushed us to the brink of war with Iran, and kept us in the horrific Saudi-led war in Yemen. We can't just have photo opportunities. We need real diplomacy."
472,Sanders,@david_l_alvarez Thank you. My condolences and thoughts are with you and your family. Your father is an example of what America is all about.
473,Sanders,"Today, we mourn the loss of Luis Alvarez, a champion for the health of 9/11 first responders, and one of the selfless men and women who searched for survivors at Ground Zero. We must build a society where we take care of each other and treat heath care as a human right."
474,Sanders,"Fifty years after the Stonewall Uprising, let us reflect on how the struggle for justice, dignity and equality is advanced. #Stonewall50"
475,Sanders,"Today, I stood with a majority of my Senate colleagues who voted to uphold the rule of law. The Constitution and the War Powers Act are perfectly clear: President Trump cannot go to war with Iran without congressional authorization."
476,Sanders,"I am proud that @NEAToday, which represents 3 million educators, supports our College for All Act. Canceling student debt lets more people to follow their passion to teach in public school. And tuition-free college and trade school ensures education as a right, not a privilege."
477,Sanders,"I agree: ""To some, this will appear too radical. To us, College for All is the bold solution we need. It is high time we enacted policies that benefit the real job creators‚Äîthe ones on Main Street."""
478,Sanders,I thank these 100 scholars for supporting our College For All Act. Young people face lower living standards than their parents enjoyed. We must act boldly and decisively to wipe out student debt and make education a right‚Äîand Wall Street will pay for it.
479,Sanders,"You've got questions‚Äî@RepJayapal, @Ilhan and I have got answers. How do we cancel $1.6 trillion in student debt? We pay for it in a very simple way: a small tax on Wall Street speculation. This is not a ""radical"" idea."
480,Sanders,"Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply for a paid internship in Senator Sanders' Burlington and Washington, D.C. offices by June 30."
481,Sanders,"These deaths are what a broken immigration system is all about. Instead of demonizing immigrants, Trump should be meeting with Central American leaders to find ways to end the horrific violence and poverty that are forcing people to flee their homelands."
482,Sanders,"As a child, @RepJimmyGomez grew up without health insurance. Today he is calling for Medicare for All to guarantee health care to every person, so that no one has to go through what his family did."
483,Sanders,Here's how we do it:
484,Sanders,Cancel all of it.
485,Sanders,"El Congreso asign√≥ fondos para asistencia nutricional de emergencia hace semanas. Mientras los puertorrique√±os pasan hambre, @USDA, @SecretarySonny, @OMBPress, y @MickMulvaneyOMB mantienen esta ayuda en el limbo burocr√°tico. ¬°La administraci√≥n debe proveer estos fondos ahora!"
486,Sanders,"""I know smart, talented, debt-laden millennials who graduated into a post-Great Recession job market so mean and miserly that it literally had them eating out of Dumpsters."" #CancelStudentDebt"
487,Sanders,"I don't often use this phrase, but today, we offered a truly revolutionary proposal to transform and improve our country in many ways. All of our people regardless of income deserve the education they need. #CollegeForAll #CancelStudentDebt"
488,Sanders,We are saying that all public colleges and universities should be tuition-free and debt-free for ALL Americans. All Americans are entitled to Social Security.All Americans are entitled to health care.All Americans are entitled to education as a right.
489,Sanders,"I believe in universality. That means if Trump wants to send his grandchildren to public school, he has that right. Wealthy kids go to public school right now. At the same time, we will make Wall Street, the top 1% and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes."
490,Sanders,"I agree with Harvard Business School professor Marco Di Maggio. Lifting the burden of student loans allows people to make better decisions, feel more freedom to make changes in their careers, and spend more money, which goes back into the economy."
491,Sanders,"Thank you to @RepJayapal and @Ilhan for your bold leadership as co-sponsors of college for all and debt cancellation in the U.S. House.To tax Wall Street and stop the student debt crisis, we need a movement. Working together, we will #CancelStudentDebt for 45 million Americans."
492,Sanders,"Congress passed emergency nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico weeks ago. While Puerto Ricans are going hungry, @USDA, @SecretarySonny, @OMBPress, and @MickMulvaneyOMB are holding the funds in red tape limbo. The administration should immediately release these funds."
493,Sanders,"Student debt disproportionately impacts African Americans and Latinos. 12 years after starting college, the median Black borrower owes more than he or she has taken out in the first place. Canceling student debt is an act of racial and economic justice."
494,Sanders,My colleagues @RepJayapal and @Ilhan are joining me to answer your questions on how we will #CancelStudentDebt. How does it work? How is it paid for? This is a crisis that we can solve if we have the political will. Watch live:
495,Sanders,I am going to make a prediction. The major opponents of our legislation to cancel $1.6 trillion in student debt‚Äîmark my words‚Äîwill be the exact same people who said we had to bail out Wall Street to the tune of billions upon billions of dollars.
496,Sanders,I am introducing legislation to tax Wall Street and eliminate the student debt of more than 40 million Americans with @RepJayapal and @Ilhan. It is time to #CancelStudentDebt. Watch LIVE now:
497,Sanders,"During the financial crisis, Wall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in American history. Now it is Wall Street‚Äôs turn to help rebuild the disappearing middle class. #CancelStudentDebt"
498,Sanders,"The United States once led the world in the percentage of young college graduates. Today, we are in 11th place, one in every four Americans has student debt, and 40 percent of all borrowers are expected to default by 2023. #CancelStudentDebt"
499,Sanders,"This is truly a revolutionary proposal: all Americans will get the college education or job training they need, while having all student debt forgiven. We bailed out Wall Street in 2008. It‚Äôs time to tax Wall Street‚Äôs greed to help the American people."
500,Sanders,This school teacher is one of many millions of Americans who is being crushed by insurmountable student debt. More than 1 million people default on their student loans each year. We have got to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
501,Sanders,"Wealthy TV ""experts"" are shaming millennials for buying coffee and avocado toast. But young people are broke because they‚Äôre drowning in debt and low wages. The ruling class wants to divide the young and old to distract us from an economy that‚Äôs rigged for the richest 1%."
502,Sanders,"Nearly half of all college students are going hungry and the average college senior takes on $30,000 in debt. But let's go beyond statistics. Share your personal story in a video or tweet, with the hashtag #CollegeForAll. And tell me what we should be doing to fix this crisis."
503,Sanders,"If ICE agents show up at your door, know your rights.Si agentes del ICE llegan a tu puerta, conoce tus derechos."
504,Sanders,Let us not kid ourselves. It is very easy for politicians like Trump to pound the table and talk about how tough they are. But it will not be the sons and daughters of billionaires who get killed in a war with Iran. It will be the working class kids of this country.
505,Sanders,A war with Iran would be a disaster and lead to endless conflict in the region. Congress must assert its constitutional authority and stop Trump from going to war.
506,Sanders,"The president must respect the will of the majority of the Senate, which voted today to block weapons from being transferred to the brutal Saudi dictatorship. The Saudis are using U.S.-made bombs to kill people in Yemen and creating a horrific humanitarian disaster."
507,Sanders,"The insurance industry is mounting a multi-million dollar campaign against Medicare for All. They want you to believe that the Canadian health care system that guarantees health care to every man, woman and child in that country is a disaster.They are dead wrong."
508,Sanders,Congratulations to the advocates who fought to pass this landmark bill to radically cut New York State‚Äôs carbon pollution and transform its energy system. This is a step in the right direction toward the type of bold action on climate change that we need.
509,Sanders,"This president is going to have to learn that he is not a dictator, that there is a Constitution and a separation of powers in this country."
510,Sanders,"If you think the invasion of Iraq was a disaster, a war with Iran would be worse. The United States must bring Iran and Saudi Arabia to the negotiating table, not foment a never-ending, unconstitutional war in the region."
511,Sanders,"This is outrageous. President Trump‚Äôs proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan is a stark reminder that instead of worrying about the future of our planet, he is more concerned with protecting the interests of his friends in the fossil fuel industry."
512,Sanders,"The only thing Medicaid work requirements are good at is kicking people off their coverage. If the GOP wants to help people find work, they should invest in employment programs and guarantee health care as a right‚Äînot punish people who are struggling."
513,Sanders,Representative Jayapal is exactly right. There is no such thing as a limited nuclear war. The $13 billion cost of this nuclear weapon would be much better spent fighting poverty and rebuilding the middle class. Thank you for standing up to the military industrial complex.
514,Sanders,"A new United Nations report confirms what the CIA said: Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. It is time for the United States to reevaluate our relationship with this brutal regime, including ending support for the catastrophic Yemen war."
515,Sanders,I'm proud to celebrate #Juneteenth with @MrDannyGlover. This year's holiday takes on special significance because of today's House hearing on H.R. 40 to study the impacts of slavery. We must come to terms with slavery's horrors and how they affect every aspect of our lives today.
516,Sanders,The president won't address our health care crisis or climate change. But he will try to divide us up and go after undocumented people who have very little political power. That is what demagogues always do and that is why he must be defeated.
517,Sanders,"Mr. President: Respect the Constitution. You have no legal authority to launch an attack on Iran. Come to Congress, present your evidence, and make your case. If not, we will assert our power under the War Powers Act to stop you."
518,Sanders,"Itta Bena, Mississippi is a ""banking desert"" where residents are without basic banking services. This is why @AOC and I are calling for the return of postal banking in the United States. The big banks of this country are preying on poor people or ignoring them completely."
519,Sanders,"It‚Äôs a national disgrace that a minimum wage worker cannot afford a modest one-bedroom apartment in 99% of counties in America. All Americans have a right to a decent, affordable home."
520,Sanders,"Hoping for a full recovery for Red Sox great David ""Big Papi"" Ortiz, one of the most outstanding and popular baseball players in recent memory."
521,Sanders,"Blackrock's role in destroying our planet is unacceptable. Our future is not in fossil fuel investments. Our future is shifting to sustainable energy, creating millions of jobs, leading the world in new technology and leaving our children a clean environment."
522,Sanders,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs demeaning. It‚Äôs demoralizing. It‚Äôs unjust.‚Äù That's what a rigged political system looks like. As a House member in 1999, I led a trip to Canada to buy cheaper drugs. Twenty years later, people are still organizing 'caravans' to buy insulin they need."
523,Sanders,"While CEO pay has exploded, the minimum wage has lost more than 15 percent of its value since the last time it was raised. This is a starvation wage for 40 million people and everyone knows it. Congress must stand with the working people of this country. #RaisetheWage"
524,Sanders,"This is not right: When it comes to who can afford to pay off their college debt and move on with their lives, there is a significant racial gap. Our job is to make public colleges tuition-free and substantially reduce student debt in this country."
525,Sanders,"The Gulf of Oman incident must not be used as a pretext for war with Iran. War would be an unmitigated disaster for the United States, Iran, the region, and the world. A unilateral U.S. attack on Iran would be illegal and unconstitutional."
526,Sanders,America‚Äôs economic rise relied on treating Black people as literal property. We have not come to terms with the horrors of slavery and its continued impacts on our society. I am proud to cosponsor this bill to study and develop reparations proposals.
527,Sanders,"Climate change is one of the greatest threats to global security. As we see more drought, as poor people are not able to grow the food they need, there will be migrations of millions of people all over the world. That is why we need a Green New Deal."
528,Sanders,"""I do not begrudge any pregnant person‚Äôs personal choice, whatever it is. That is, in fact, the whole point.""I hope Americans who do not believe in abortion will consider this powerful op-ed by @RepJayapal. Abortion must remain a constitutional right."
529,Sanders,It is sick and disgraceful that pharmaceutical executives conspired to cover up their greedy price-fixing scheme when @RepCummings and I launched an investigation. They need to be investigated and held accountable by our criminal justice system.
530,Sanders,"Donald Trump may not like it, but we are not an authoritarian country. The OSC recommendation is very clear: Ms. Conway must be removed from the federal government for violating the law."
531,Sanders,"Can you believe it? Amazon is issuing credit cards with 28% interest rates to ""help"" people with bad credit. This kind of greed makes the poor even poorer and @AOC and I intend to outlaw it. Corporations will have to survive on a 15% cap on interest rates."
532,Sanders,"Three years ago, 49 people lost their lives in the Pulse nightclub shooting. It is absurd that we have not passed common sense gun safety legislation by now‚Äîall because the GOP is in the pocket of the NRA. My thoughts are with those who are remembering their loved ones today."
533,Sanders,"Today is historic! The powerful House @WaysMeansCmte is holding a hearing on universal health care ‚Äîa major step toward passing #MedicareforAll.Watch @RepJayapal and @RepDebDingell explain what this hearing means, and how we advance the fight for health care as a human right."
534,Sanders,"The internment of Japanese Americans is a stain on our history. It abhorrent that 75 years later, this administration now wants to hold migrant children in one of those same camps. We will look back on Trump‚Äôs racist child prisons as an abomination."
535,Sanders,"During his presidency, Lula da Silva oversaw huge reductions in poverty and remains Brazil‚Äôs most popular politician. I stand with political and social leaders across the globe who are calling on Brazil‚Äôs judiciary to release Lula and annul his conviction."
536,Sanders,"Four million Americans live in Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. But their health care is not funded at the same level as the rest of the country.These inequities cannot stand, and today, I am introducing new legislation to fix them."
537,Sanders,"El pueblo boricua sigue enfrent√°ndose a una crisis y merece recibir todos los fondos federales para la atenci√≥n de salud basada en la necesidad. Ya lleg√≥ la hora de que EE.UU trate a la gente de Puerto Rico como ciudadanos, no como sujetos coloniales."
538,Sanders,"I'm proud of my home state of Vermont for reaffirming the right to abortion, at a time when Roe v. Wade is under attack by right-wing extremists across the country. We cannot go back to the days when women did not have the right to control their own bodies."
539,Sanders,Very glad to do so. Health care is a human right.
540,Sanders,The Trump administration should start paying attention to the serious problems facing our country and let the people of the United Kingdom decide their own political future.
541,Sanders,"‚ùå Gut the Voting Rights Act‚ùå Cut early voting‚ùå Purge voter rolls‚ùå Close polling locations‚ùå Pass restrictive voter ID lawsWhen I look at the Republican Party‚Äôs efforts to make it harder for people to vote, I have to wonder: Do they truly believe in democracy?"
542,Sanders,"This is what oligarchy looks like. Amazon used its enormous wealth and power to kill a tax to build affordable housing in Seattle. One year later, thousands of people live on the streets, and the city continues to struggle with the crisis."
543,Sanders,"Thank you, Reginald Brown, for sharing your story. I am proud to stand with you to make sure we do not go backward on health care. We are fighting for Medicare for All to make sure that Reginald and every HIV-positive American can afford the lifesaving medicine they need to live."
544,Sanders,We have got to end the embarrassment of being the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee paid leave.
545,Sanders,"If the Majority Leader wants to defend starvation wages to the people of Kentucky, that is his right. But I say to Mitch McConnell: let the American people have a vote on a $15 minimum wage."
546,Sanders,"The Green New Deal is not only about saving our planet, it is about creating millions of jobs for the American people‚Äîfamily-sustaining, union jobs with benefits. Thank you, @SEIU. This is what leadership and solidarity are about."
547,Sanders,Trump backs Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen and sells them bombs they drop on children. Now he wants @Raytheon to help Saudis develop their own weapons. Congress must stop this president from doing the bidding of the arms industry and this brutal regime.
548,Sanders,This is corruption in plain sight. Remember when Mr. Trump told us that he was going to drain the swamp? What a joke.
549,Sanders,"As we come together to celebrate #NationalDoughnutDay, let me be perfectly clear: contrary to what you may hear from Fox News, Medicare for All will not limit your donut consumption.We cannot glaze over the fact that America does not guarantee health care as a human right."
550,Sanders,I want to applaud @RepJoeNeguse for this passionate defense of country's immigrants and Dreamers‚Äîkids who are American in every way but a piece of paper.
551,Sanders,"It's no secret the @SenateGOP does corporate America's bidding. Well, guess what? Thanks to workers standing up, Amazon and Disney now pay $15 an hour.So I'm asking @Senatemajldr McConnell: if huge corporations can raise wages, why can't you? Let us vote on a $15 minimum wage."
552,Sanders,"75 years ago at Normandy, the United States and its allies led the largest land invasion in history to help free Europe from Nazi barbarism. We will never forget the young people who gave their lives. We honor them by working toward a world of freedom, dignity and peace for all."
553,Sanders,Thousands of transgender individuals are often disrespected and denied health care services due to their gender identity. That‚Äôs unacceptable. The Equality Act is an important first step to ensure the transgender community gets the respect and dignity they deserve. #PrideMonth
554,Sanders,"Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply for a paid internship in Senator Sanders' Burlington and Washington, D.C. offices, including press internships. Applications are due on June 22nd."
555,Sanders,"Trump‚Äôs border wall request: $8.6 billionTax cuts for the wealthy: $1.5 trillion""Space Force"" annual budget: $1.3 billionSoccer and legal aid for children locked up at the border: $0 How obscene is it that this administration blames ‚Äúbudget pressures‚Äù to punish little kids."
556,Sanders,"Wall Street bankers say @AOC and I are wrong to advance the Loan Shark Prevention Act, which would put an end to sky-high interest rates on loans and credit cards. Guess what? They're wrong.Now economists are joining the fight. And they are on our side."
557,Sanders,"Mr. Trump now says he prefers to talk to Iran, after threatening a disastrous military conflict with them. Good.The president can show he is serious about diplomacy by rejoining the nuclear deal he recklessly withdrew from last year."
558,Sanders,"Trump's Mexico tariffs aren't about trade, it's about a fake border ""crisis"" to scapegoat migrants. No wonder it's unpopular. We should be working to address migration‚Äôs root causes by ending our militarized drug war and race-to-the-bottom trade policies."
559,Sanders,"China, with one-third our per capita income, leads on electric vehicles and renewable energy, while Trump says climate change is a hoax. A Green New Deal would invest in building our electric buses, trains and cars here in America with good union wages."
560,Sanders,"For the millions of DREAMers and TPS holders whose lives have been thrown into chaos by Mr. Trump‚Äôs bigotry, we have got to pass this legislation now. I call on Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring this bill to the floor for a vote immediately."
561,Sanders,LGBTQ people face unacceptable workplace discrimination and abuse. I say to the huge corporations rainbow-branding themselves for #PrideMonth:Pay your employees fairly.Let them unionize.Support their right to health care.Do not cheapen the struggle for dignity and freedom.
562,Sanders,Let's not forget that the middle class was built by organized labor. I am very concerned to see that @BuzzFeed still hasn't recognized the union formed by its newsroom employees. Our Workplace Democracy Act will put an end to corporations getting away with these stalling tactics.
563,Sanders,"I cannot understand this way of thinking from White House advisor Jared Kushner. It is not moral to have benefitted from the safe haven America provided our parents and grandparents fleeing violence, only to then slam the door shut on today's refugees."
564,Sanders,I believe it is wrong to charge Americans astronomical prices for life-saving drugs developed with taxpayer dollars. You will not find me encouraging pharmaceutical companies to continue ripping off Americans like my Republican colleagues.
565,Sanders,I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again: It is outrageous that the Walton family makes more in one minute than a Walmart worker earns in a year. It is not radical to end taxpayer subsidies for this wealthy corporation and have it pay its employees a living wage of $15 an hour.
566,Sanders,"22 Senators just voted for an extreme budget to cut Medicare and Medicaid IN HALF, throwing millions off their health care, while extending Trump's tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.When Republicans tell us who they are and what they want for this country, we should believe them."
567,Sanders,"Big surprise: Under Trump, another head of a federal agency who is supposed to serve the public good is actually furthering family and business interests. The corruption and nepotism of this administration, from Trump on down, never ends."
568,Sanders,"3,000 of our fellow Americans died in Hurricane Maria. Instead of being allowed to recover, Puerto Rico faces cuts to health and education. We must stop treating the island as a colony. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and deserve to live with dignity."
569,Sanders,The Trump administration serves one group of people in America: the top 1%.
570,Sanders,"I applaud New Hampshire for becoming the 21st state to abolish the death penalty. Too many innocent people, particularly racial minorities, get caught up in this unjust policy. A civilized society shouldn‚Äôt be involved in the murder of other Americans."
571,Sanders,More proof that this administration wants to rig the 2020 Census to undercount minorities‚Äîand they‚Äôre trying to cover it up. The census must not be turned into a partisan weapon. Immigrant communities have a right to equal representation and funding.
572,Sanders,"The 2008 Wall Street bailout was never meant to help ordinary people. It only emboldened Wall Street‚Äôs greed, recklessness and fraud. Bonuses went up, no one went to jail. That‚Äôs why I voted against it. It‚Äôs time to break up the big banks once and for all."
573,Sanders,"Nonpartisan experts confirmed to @HouseBudgetDems that #MedicareforAll could offer universal coverage, lower costs, and stronger wages. I applaud @USProgressives @RepJohnYarmuth, @RepJayapal and @RepRoKhanna for holding this hearing to build the case for health care as a right."
574,Sanders,"How sick is Trump's revolving door? The current head of the EPA protecting our air is Andrew Wheeler, an ex-coal lobbyist. Before him, Scott Pruitt ignored his own scientists to make Wisconsin breathe in more smog. Now he works for the coal industry, too."
575,Sanders,"In support of our wonderful ‚Äúally,‚Äù Saudi Arabia, Trump has provoked war with Iran and kept us in an unconstitutional war in Yemen. Instead of giving the Saudis more bombs, he should take a hard look at the brutal, antidemocratic regime he loves so much."
576,Sanders,"If Eddie Lampert has enough money to buy a $130-million, 288-foot yacht, he damn well has enough money to pay the $43 million severance package he promised to the workers at Sears, whose jobs were destroyed as a result of his greed and mismanagement."
577,Sanders,"How can it be that six migrant children have died in U.S. custody in the last eight months? In the previous decade, this hadn't happened even once. We need an investigation. Trump's racism, xenophobia and incompetence cannot be allowed to continue."
578,Sanders,"As a candidate, Trump promised he'd stop outsourcing good-paying American jobs. He lied. Instead, by protecting their patents, Trump is trying to make it easier for corporations like Pfizer, GE, Boeing and Microsoft to ship more American jobs to China."
579,Sanders,Nurses know better than anyone how our for-profit health care system is incompatible with health care itself. I applaud @NationalNurses for their leadership to guarantee health care is a human right for
580,Sanders,"In America today, the average student-loan debt for a four-year degree is over $28,000. When asked how big their student debt was, people from Denmark, Taiwan, Ireland, Brazil, the Philippines, Scotland, Turkey, and Canada all gave the same answer:"
581,Sanders,"Given the reality that we have a president who believes he is above the law, Congress must continue its investigations. If the House Judiciary Committee deems it necessary, I will support their decision to open an impeachment inquiry."
582,Sanders,"McConnell said he‚Äôd fill a Supreme Court vacancy in 2020 after blocking hearings for Merrick Garland. What a hypocrite. Make no mistake about it, McConnell's goal has always been the same: lifetime appointments for extreme rightwing judges by any means."
583,Sanders,"This is insane: As Oklahoma and Arkansas face catastrophic flooding, and Ohio and Indiana reel from tornados, Trump is trying to undermine the very science that proves climate change is real. We need policy based on facts, not rightwing ideology."
584,Sanders,"This is a public health crisis: The last remaining clinic in Missouri that provides safe, legal abortion could be shut down within hours. We must fight the extremists who, in state after state, are waging a war against women."
585,Sanders,"The establishment says there's no alternative to an unfettered capitalism that produces huge CEO bonuses while millions are paid starvation wages. They are dead wrong. Instead of more tax breaks to profitable corporations, let‚Äôs expand employee ownership."
586,Sanders,".@AGWilliamTong and 43 other attorneys general have damning proof that major drug companies have been colluding on price, stealing billions from American patients and taxpayers.I look forward to working with him to ensure they are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."
587,Sanders,"This Memorial Day, we say to veterans who came home from war that we honor your service, and we will make sure every man and woman who has served our country gets the very best health care they can through a strong Veterans Administration."
588,Sanders,"While we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice, we must also remember our veterans. As the former Chair of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I believe we must strengthen the VA and guarantee that all veterans receive the quality health care they earned."
589,Sanders,"Today, on this Memorial Day, we remember and honor all those men and women who gave their lives to defend our country, American values and our democracy. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten."
590,Sanders,I say to the right-wing extremists who want to roll back Roe v. Wade: Abortion is a constitutional right and we are going to keep it that way.
591,Sanders,"How many kids suffer from mercury, lead, and soot in their air? And the most polluting incinerators in America hurt low-income and minority neighborhoods the most. We need clean air and water for all‚Äînot a government that works on behalf of polluters."
592,Sanders,"I agree with these 76 retired generals and admirals, who warn that a war with Iran would be a disaster for the region and for U.S. security, and who urge Trump to pursue diplomacy rather than an unnecessary conflict."
593,Sanders,I understand President Trump is blocking a resolution at the @WHO that would require drug companies to disclose actual R&amp;D costs for pharmaceutical drugs. Nobody should believe Mr. Trump when he talks about taking on Big Pharma.
594,Sanders,"Let me be clear: it is a disturbing attack on the First Amendment for the Trump administration to decide who is or is not a reporter for the purposes of a criminal prosecution. Donald Trump must obey the Constitution, which protects the publication of news about our government."
595,Sanders,Young people have already demonstrated that they can take on powerful fossil fuel companies and force politicians to answer their call to action. To the more than 1 million people walking out for climate justice today: I stand with you.
596,Sanders,I was right about Vietnam.I was right about Iraq.I will do everything in my power to prevent a war with Iran.I apologize to no one.
597,Sanders,"Trump said he would ‚Äústop Wall Street from getting away with murder."" Instead, he deregulated Wall Street and gave them a $20 billion tax break. I've got a better idea. We're going to make Wall Street pay its fair share and stop reckless speculation."
598,Sanders,I support the Transport Workers Union in their struggle against American Airlines. This is what a strong union and strong union leadership is about:
599,Sanders,"It is obvious that the President is a pathological liar who does not understand the Constitution. The fact is that if Mr. Trump continues to disregard the right of Congress to subpoena, he will leave House Members with no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry."
600,Sanders,"Thank you @chefjoseandres for stopping by to talk about the amazing work you did in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria! The full resources of the United States must be used to ensure that Puerto Rico gets the food, water, housing, and electricity they still desperately need."
601,Sanders,"""How do you pay for it?"" This is how. Watch live as @RepBarbaraLee and I introduce legislation to tax Wall Street greed."
602,Sanders,
603,Sanders,"Yes, facts matter. Delta workers don't make as little as $9 an hour. They make as little as $8.25 an hour. It's time for Delta's CEO to stop misleading, stop discouraging workers from joining a union and pay all of them a living wage with good benefits."
604,Sanders,"This afternoon, I attended a Senate intelligence briefing where the Trump administration presented its policy on Iran. Without going into specifics, let me just say: If you think the war in Iraq was a disaster, in all likelihood a war with Iran would be far worse."
605,Sanders,"It is obvious Secretary DeVos wants to dismantle and privatize public education. No wonder she calls unions and local governments an ""empire"" to defeat. Our communities need an advocate for public education, not a billionaire advancing the interests of for-profit industry."
606,Sanders,"Can you believe this? We, as taxpayers, spent millions to develop a treatment for HIV. @GileadSciences disregarded our government patent to charge $2,000 a month for the very same drug. We have got to stop Big Pharma from price-gouging the American people."
607,Sanders,"Trump, the schoolyard bully, is threatening to take us into another war in the Middle East. Just what we need! But it will not be Trump's or his billionaire friend's kids and grandkids who fight and die in that war. It will be working-class kids. No war with Iran!"
608,Sanders,"We must not only make public colleges tuition-free, but we must substantially reduce student debt in this country. It is absolutely absurd that millions of Americans are paying off debts for decades because they got a higher education."
609,Sanders,Billionaire Robert F. Smith's gift to forgive the student debts of the graduating class of Morehouse College was extremely generous. But the student crisis will not be solved by charity. It must be addressed by governmental action.
610,Sanders,"The people of Yemen are suffering because of a disastrous, brutal war. We should be ending that war, not funding it. On this issue and many others, I don‚Äôt see why we would want to be seen as a close ally of Saudi Arabia, which is a despotic, un-democratic regime."
611,Sanders,"Black babies make up only 14% of the infant population, yet make up 30% of all infant deaths. That is unacceptable. We must address the systemic and implicit racism present in maternal care for black mothers, as well as other mothers of color."
612,Sanders,"Congratulations to all those in House of Representatives who voted on the right side of history today. All people, regardless of who they are or who they love, deserve fair and equal treatment. #EqualityAct"
613,Sanders,"I fully support these medical workers in Ohio, who are striking to make St. Vincent Medical Center put patients over profits. They are on the right side of history."
614,Sanders,"To the @SenateMajldr: The House did its job. Now, I call on you to bring the #EqualityAct to the Senate floor so that we finally protect LGBTQ people across America from discrimination in housing, employment and other critical parts of their lives. Do your job."
615,Sanders,Today's modern-day loan sharks are no longer lurking on street corners‚Äîthey wear Armani suits and work on Wall Street. @RepAOC and I have a ‚Äúradical‚Äù idea: no bank in America should charge an interest rate higher than 15%.
616,Sanders,It is not an American value to talk about rounding up millions of people and throwing them out of the country. That is xenophobia and racism.
617,Sanders,"Mr. Trump and his cabinet cannot seem to get on the same page when it comes to raising the min. wage to $15 an hour. It is not that complicated: Too many Americans are working 40+ hours a week and still cannot afford basic necessities. They need a living wage, not poverty pay."
618,Sanders,"We know what the goal of the far right is: overturn Roe v. Wade and outlaw all abortion in America. It is not a stretch to say that this would, quite literally, kill women. Here's how we fight back:"
619,Sanders,"Should antitrust action be taken against Facebook? The answer is yes, of course. We have an increasingly monopolistic society, where you have a handful of very large corporations with far too much power over American consumers. That has got to change."
620,Sanders,"This is sickening. We have seen a terrible level of police violence against unarmed African Americans: Sandra Bland, Rekia Boyd and now Pamela Turner. We need an investigation of this shooting and immediate reform to our racist criminal justice system."
621,Sanders,"The same CEOs who say we can't afford to guarantee health care as a right had no problem paying themselves $2.6 billion last year. Working together, we will end the greed and profiteering of private health insurance companies and move to #MedicareforAll."
622,Sanders,"This woman's mother died of a self-induced abortion in 1944, when abortions were strictly criminal. In limiting access to abortion, all we are doing is eliminating safe and monitored abortions."
623,Sanders,"I thank my colleagues @SenSherrodBrown, @SenBobCasey, @RonWyden, @SenatorBaldwin, @SenBlumenthal, @SenMarkey, @SenWarren, and @SenJeffMerkley for joining me in this effort to stand with workers and against the outrageous greed of Delta Air Lines."
624,Sanders,Workers have the constitutional right to form a union and negotiate for better wages. Delta‚Äôs union-busting tactics are reprehensible. My colleagues and I urge Delta's CEO to end this insulting and demeaning campaign of intimidation.
625,Sanders,"The Alabama Senate voted to outlaw nearly all abortions. These hypocrites decry ""big government,"" yet they want to control every aspect of women's bodies, private decisions, and futures. Our job is to fight at every step to protect reproductive rights."
626,Sanders,The United States Congress must do everything it can to prevent the Trump Administration‚Äôs attempts to put us on the brink of a catastrophic and unconstitutional war with Iran.
627,Sanders,"Join me live on Twitter and Facebook in a few moments, as I lay out my strong opposition to the Trump Administration's attempts to put us on the brink of a catastrophic and unconstitutional war with Iran."
628,Sanders,"From disenfranchising ex-felons to extreme gerrymandering, here are the 5 ways the Republican party is trying to suppress the vote. The great political crisis we face is not voter fraud, which barely exists. It is voter suppression and the denial of voting rights."
629,Sanders,"NO WAR WITH IRAN! This would be an unmitigated disaster. We must stop Trump and his national security advisor, John Bolton‚Äîsomeone who likes endless wars."
630,Sanders,Americans must not be forced to continue paying outrageously high and inflated prices for the medicine they need. Congress must stand up to the powerful pharmaceutical industry and substantially lower drug prices in this country.
631,Sanders,"Pharma executives allegedly deleted their texts and lied to our offices to conceal a conspiracy to fix prices, raising them by as much as 1000%. How many have died as a result of this racket? @RepCummings and I will hold these companies accountable."
632,Sanders,"When we rally for a Green New Deal, we are rallying to create millions of good clean energy jobs, rallying for racial justice, and rallying to save the only planet that we have. Watch live now at @sunrisemvmt or at https://t.co/2IjiXNhSoF."
633,Sanders,"Mr. President: Stop dividing the American people up by their religion, their race or their country of origin--and stop your ugly attacks against Muslim women in Congress. You are taking Rep. @RashidaTlaib's comments out of context and should apologize."
634,Sanders,"Victor Orban is undermining democracy in Hungary, just as Donald Trump is in the United States. The job of the President of the United States should be to stand up for democratic values, not embrace leaders who reject them."
635,Sanders,"In The Divine Comedy, Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of Hell for people who charged usurious interest rates. Today we don‚Äôt need the hellfire, but we do need a national usury law that caps interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 percent."
636,Sanders,"Jane and I, our four kids and seven grandchildren, want to take this opportunity to wish all of the great mothers of our country a very happy Mother's Day."
637,Sanders,"Making certain that future generations have a planet that is healthy and habitable is a moral imperative. With their activism, young people are taking the lead in the fight against climate change. I look forward to speaking to the @sunrisemvmt tomorrow."
638,Sanders,"How insane is this. We tell young people to get the best education they can, and then saddle them for decades with student debt. We must make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and substantially reduce student debt."
639,Sanders,"Think of it. Instead of spending trillions on wars, strong U.S. presidential leadership could bring the world together in the fight against climate change and the need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels."
640,Sanders,"Once again, our critics are wrong: a new study found that in cities and states where wages went up, other low-wage workers got a bump in pay, and overall employment did not decrease. It's long past time for Congress to pass a $15-an-hour living wage."
641,Sanders,I applaud Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes for sounding the alarm on the dangers of unchecked corporate power. We are living in an era of monopolies that dominate every aspect of our lives‚Äîincluding our government. It‚Äôs time to take that power back.
642,Sanders,Rep. Ocasio-Cortez is right. The big banks prey on poor people with high interest rates or ignore them entirely. The vast majority of postal services around the world allow their customers to use basic banking services without outrageous fees and interest rates. So should we.
643,Sanders,"88 percent of the American people support capping credit card interest rates. They are sick and tired of being ripped off by Wall Street banks that are making record profits. Working together, we will end their greed."
644,Sanders,"Credit card interest rates are outrageously high. With @RepAOC, we are introducing legislation to challenge the greed of Wall Street and protect consumers across America."
645,Sanders,My colleague @RepAOC and I have a radical idea: maybe Congress should stand up for ordinary people. Join us at noon today on Twitter as we launch our legislation to protect consumers and take on the greed of the big banks.
646,Sanders,"At a time when climate change is the greatest crisis facing the planet, Microsoft and Google are making billion dollar deals with the fossil fuel industry. Our job: Break our addiction to fossil fuels and transform our energy system toward sustainable sources of energy."
647,Sanders,I urge Catalyst Pharmaceuticals to respond to this FDA decision by lowering its own outrageous prices. No patient should worry about whether they will suffer or die just to increase the obscene profits of a pharmaceutical company.
648,Sanders,"Today, I went to the the National Archives, where our Constitution is housed, to say to @realDonaldTrump: You are not a dictator and you must obey the Constitution."
649,Sanders,"By withdrawing from the Iran nuclear agreement, a move opposed by his own top security officials, Trump has isolated the U.S. from its closest allies and put us on a dangerous path to conflict. We should rejoin the deal and work with allies to effectively enforce it."
650,Sanders,The House Judiciary Committee is doing the right thing by voting to hold Mr. Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena. No Attorney General is above the law. Mr. Barr must testify‚Äîthe American people have a right to know.
651,Sanders,Uber and Lyft drivers are struggling as they work for billion-dollar companies. These drivers are not ‚Äúindependent contractors‚Äù‚Äîthey are employees who deserve rights and benefits. I stand in solidarity with them as they strike today for a dignified life.
652,Sanders,"There's no doubt in my mind that Sandra Bland, like too many African Americans who die in police custody, would be alive today if she were a white woman. I support her family‚Äôs call for a renewed investigation into her arrest and death."
653,Sanders,This blatant and unconstitutional attack on women's rights must be stopped. Women have a fundamental right to control their own bodies and futures.
654,Sanders,"Monopolies are harming the livelihoods of rural Americans. A handful of companies dominate the markets for seeds, equipment, meat packing, and patents. We need to put an end to corporate mergers and break up Big Ag so family farmers can get a fair shake."
655,Sanders,"Ady Barkan has health insurance but is still facing $9,000 a month in out-of-pocket medical expenses. He is dying from a terrible neurological disease and using the time he has left to testify before Congress. When we enact Medicare for All, it will be because of heroes like Ady."
656,Sanders,"Unlike Donald Trump, most Americans do not believe that a free press is ""the enemy of the people."" I am delighted that Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were released from a Myanmar prison after 500 days in prison."
657,Sanders,"Congratulations to the advocates in Oregon who won a major victory today. The right to a clean environment is more important than the short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry. Our job: break our addiction to fossil fuels, not increase our dependence on fracked natural gas."
658,Sanders,I am so grateful to America's nurses. Nurses are the backbone of our health care system and it is no wonder Americans trust them more than any other profession. They deserve tremendous respect and support from all of us.
659,Sanders,"We must combat oligarchy. A new study shows that the top 10% now own 70% of the wealth, while the bottom half have virtually no net wealth at all. We need an economy that works for all, not just the few."
660,Sanders,The people of Puerto Rico have been experiencing a humanitarian crisis for over a year and a half since Hurricane Maria. It is totally unconscionable that in the wealthiest nation in the world we have allowed our fellow citizens to suffer for so long.
661,Sanders,"The average household with credit card debt owes over $15,000. The average interest rate on these cards? Above 17%. Soon, I‚Äôll introduce legislation to put a stop to this. How have steep interest rates and fees impacted you? Please share your story."
662,Sanders,"Climate change is destroying our ecosystems and our planet. We must take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry, and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy."
663,Sanders,"Sorry, Mr. President, you are not a dictator. In our democracy, when Congress calls on Robert Mueller to testify, he will testify."
664,Sanders,"This is obscene: while the top 25 hedge-fund managers each take home an average of $850 million a year, nearly half of college students have to skip meals for the crime of pursuing an education. We must ensure tuition-free college for all, funded by a tax on Wall Street greed."
665,Sanders,The United States lags behind every major country on Earth when it comes to paid sick leave. It is time for Congress to follow the lead of states like mine and pass guaranteed sick leave for all Americans.
666,Sanders,There can be no free society without a free media. The work of journalists in this country is absolutely essential to our communities and to a free and functioning democracy. Journalists should never have to fear for their lives as they do their work. #WorldPressFreedomDay
667,Sanders,"We have a racist criminal justice system that costs us billions of dollars, ruins lives and allows private prisons to profit off of human misery. The private prison racket has got to end."
668,Sanders,"In the richest country in the history of the world, 13 million children live in poverty and two-thirds of them are children of color. This is a moral outrage. If we raise the minimum wage and invest in education and housing, we can end child poverty."
669,Sanders,"When Congress asks the Attorney General to testify or provide information, he's got to do it. I support those who are prepared to hold him in contempt for stonewalling. The American people are entitled to this information and the House should be as tough as they can be."
670,Sanders,"The Trump administration is threatening a disastrous military intervention in Venezuela. Under our Constitution, only Congress can authorize the use of force. We must make sure the United States does not get involved in yet another war and destabilize another region."
671,Sanders,"Apparently, it is not enough for the Trump administration to attack the Affordable Care Act. Now they want to open up millions of women and LGBTQ people to discrimination in health care. What we need is a health care system that covers every person's needs. No exceptions."
672,Sanders,"This is the beginning of a bipartisan process to take back our responsibility over these most important matters. My likeminded colleagues and I, in a bipartisan fashion, will utilize all of the legislative tools at our disposal‚Äîincluding further use of the War Powers Act."
673,Sanders,"The bad news today: we were unable today to override Trump‚Äôs veto regarding U.S. intervention in this horrific war in Yemen. The good news: for the first time in 45 years, Congress used the War Powers Act to reassert its constitutional responsibility over the use of armed forces."
674,Sanders,Watch live now: A bipartisan majority in the House and the Senate voted to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. We can save thousands upon thousands of people if we override Donald Trump's veto.
675,Sanders,Lives are at stake. I‚Äôm on my way to vote to override Donald Trump‚Äôs veto of our bipartisan resolution to stop U.S. involvement in the Saudi war in Yemen.
676,Sanders,"I thank my friend @JoeBiden for joining our effort to end U.S. involvement in the Saudi military campaign in Yemen, which, over four years of war, has experienced the world's worst humanitarian crisis. We must override@realDonaldTrump's veto."
677,Sanders,"I am proud to have worked with @USProgressives in the House to challenge the devastating cuts to education, health care and pensions imposed on the people of Puerto Rico. I applaud @RepRaulGrijalva for hosting a hearing to chart a just and equitable way forward."
678,Sanders,"Today, the Senate will vote on overriding Trump's veto of our bipartisan bill to end unlawful U.S. participation in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. This is not about partisan politics. What‚Äôs at stake are millions of innocent lives and our Constitution. I urge my colleagues vote yes."
679,Sanders,"Today on #CollegeSigningDay, my staff and I want to celebrate students in Vermont and across the country for their hard work and determination. Congratulations on continuing your education!"
680,Sanders,"My staff went to the offices of my Senate colleagues to share a new UN report showing that 233,000 people will die as a result of the Saudi-led war in Yemen by 2019. If we override Trump's veto of our resolution and end U.S. support for this war, we can save thousands of lives."
681,Sanders,"What a hypocrite: While Trump demonizes immigrants, his New York country club exploits undocumented workers and steals their wages. Together, we will build an economy that treats all workers with dignity."
682,Sanders,Attorney General Barr's handling of the Mueller report has been a disaster. This is what I feared and why I opposed his nomination. I look forward to Special Counsel Mueller's testimony and believe Congress must continue to investigate whether the president obstructed justice.
683,Sanders,"Remember when Mr. Trump promised the typical American family a $4,000 pay raise? That was a lie. The average worker has received an increased bonus of just 1 cent an hour since the Trump tax scam was signed into law."
684,Sanders,"""The whole myth that if you like your current insurance you can keep it - you know that is just not true."" This man suffers from 'job-lock' because he cannot afford to forgo his employer-based insurance. Our health care system is broken. That is why we need Medicare for All."
685,Sanders,"Our time on this Earth is precious. Let us honor the tremendous strength and courage of @AdyBarkan by watching his moving testimony, sharing it widely, and working tirelessly to pass #MedicareforAll to guarantee health care to every man, woman and child."
686,Sanders,"For far too long, the United States has basically had a one-party foreign policy that favors militarism over diplomacy. Thanks to the hard work of many progressives, working on Yemen and other issues, that is finally changing."
687,Sanders,"Secretary Pompeo should stop misleading the American people about the Yemen war. The fact is that Iran's role is minimal, and continued U.S. support for this Saudi-led catastrophe undermines our national security."
688,Sanders,"What would be truly heroic is if Disney used its profits from Avengers to pay all of its workers a middle class wage, instead of paying its CEO Bob Iger $65.6 million ‚Äì over 1,400 times as much as the average worker at Disney makes."
689,Sanders,"The American people are sick and tired of profitable corporations like Amazon, General Motors, Chevron and Delta making billions in profits, but paying nothing in federal income taxes. Working together, we will end a rigged tax code and political system."
690,Sanders,"""I may be dying, but I‚Äôm definitely not going quietly."" While battling terminal illness, @AdyBarkan will testify before the House Rules Committee in favor of #MedicareforAll. I want to thank him and the millions of Americans who are fighting to make health care a human right."
691,Sanders,"A new UN-commissioned report shows that the impact of the Yemen war on civilians, particularly children, is far worse than previously thought. Congress must vote to overturn Trump‚Äôs veto of our resolution and end US support for this disastrous"
692,Sanders,"I am so proud of the youth fighting against climate change. I thank them for their relentless work in the fight for a cleaner, safer world."
693,Sanders,"Six trillion dollars have been spent on the so-called war on terror. That is an unbelievable amount of money. Do we really need to spend more than the next ten nations combined on the military, when our infrastructure is collapsing and young people can't afford to go to college?"
694,Sanders,This economy leaves far too many working people struggling to make ends meet. That has got to change.
695,Sanders,"- Americans borrowed $88 billion last year to pay for health care- 65 million people didn't seek treatment because of cost That is outrageous. Under Medicare for All, no one would have to worry about being able to afford the health care they need."
696,Sanders,"Black women are dying at a disproportionately high rate of pregnancy and childbirth-related complications. We must end racial disparities in medical care, and I am proudly co-sponsoring @SenKamalaHarris' Maternal CARE Act to move us closer to equity in our health care system."
697,Sanders,How has America‚Äôs broken health care system impacted you? Do you struggle to afford medications? Are you afraid to switch jobs because you will lose coverage? The first-ever Congressional hearing on #MedicareforAll is next Tuesday. Share your story.
698,Sanders,"In the richest country in the history of the world, it is not radical to demand that when people turn on their taps, the water they drink is safe and clean. It has been 5 years since the start of the Flint water crisis. This is absolutely unacceptable."
699,Sanders,"A $15 minimum wage once seemed impossible. Since then, 6 states raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour. 29 states raised it above the national minimum of $7.25 an hour. Thanks to a strong grassroots movement, $15 has gone from laughable to inevitable."
700,Sanders,"Yesterday's mass execution underscores how urgent it has become for the United States to redefine our relationship with the despotic regime in Saudi Arabia, and to show that the Saudis do not have a blank check to continue violating human rights and dictating our foreign policy."
701,Sanders,The stock prices of massive pharmaceutical companies tumbled because we are pushing to make health care a human right for every American. Corporate greed has no place in health care.
702,Sanders,Twenty-six of the wealthiest people on Earth own more than the bottom half of the world‚Äôs population. A handful of people at the top own more than 3.6 billion people. How grotesque is that?
703,Sanders,President Trump's veto of our bipartisan resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen is a very serious challenge to Congressional authority that demands a response. We must vote to override his veto.
704,Sanders,"Today is #EarthDay. Unless we take bold action to reverse climate change, future generations will look back and ask a very simple question: ""Where were they? Why didn‚Äôt the United States of America lead on preventing the devastating damage that scientists were sure would come?"""
705,Sanders,"Hedge fund billionaire Eddie Lampert reaped huge profits while destroying the jobs of 250,000 people. This is what a rigged economy looks like. I stand with Sears and K-Mart workers all over the country who are fighting back."
706,Sanders,"I believe a peace agreement between North and South Korea is the best path for American security and for the security of the region. The United States should continue diplomatic efforts with North Korea, and support the people of South Korea as they seek to end the conflict."
707,Sanders,"The fight for Medicare for All will be opposed by some of the most powerful forces in our country. Like most movements, this fight will not be without struggle. But the American people are clear in demanding a system that guarantees health care to every man, woman and child."
708,Sanders,This is exactly the kind of future we must fight for. We have 11 short years to come together to massively transition away from fossil fuels to prevent catastrophic climate change. I am proud to co-sponsor the Green New Deal with my good friends @EdMarkey and @AOC.
709,Sanders,"I wrote about the courageous Yemeni human rights defender @RAlmutawakel, who is documenting the terrible human cost of U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's war, for @TIME's #TIME100 issue."
710,Sanders,Medicare for All means:‚úÖ No copays‚úÖ No deductibles‚úÖ Freedom of choice in doctors and hospitals‚úÖ Coverage for every AmericanThe function of our current system is to make billions of dollars for the insurance and drug companies. That is what instability looks like.
711,Sanders,"The people of Yemen desperately need humanitarian help, not more bombs.I am disappointed, but not surprised, that Trump has rejected the bi-partisan resolution to end U.S. involvement in the horrific war in Yemen."
712,Sanders,"In my view, it is long past time that we in the United States end the federal prohibition on marijuana. Now is the time to decriminalize marijuana and expunge criminal records associated with the drug."
713,Sanders,"The #MeToo movement demands real action from Congress to stop sexual harassment and abuse. That's why I'm co-sponsoring groundbreaking new legislation, to finally end mandatory arbitration and expand civil rights protections to domestic workers, interns, and contract workers."
714,Sanders,Republicans and the wealthiest Americans have worked to cut the IRS to benefit themselves. This is what a rigged economy and political system looks like.
715,Sanders,"The bigotry of the Trump administration is shameful. Our job must be to stand with the transgender community, repeal this hateful policy, and fight against discrimination wherever it appears."
716,Sanders,"Congratulations to the over 6,000 Amazon employees who are demanding their employer address the global crisis of climate change. This letter is a step in the right direction. We must come together to ensure we leave a habitable planet for our kids and grandchildren."
717,Sanders,"This is outrageous: Nurses are being forced to stop critical procedures for patients because of the insurance industry. Medicare For All would give power back to health professionals, where it belongs."
718,Sanders,The White House is scared. They say Medicare for All is the health care version of the Green New Deal. Damn right! This is about human rights. And we are going to win this struggle.
719,Sanders,"The number of huge profitable companies like Chevron and Netflix that are paying nothing in federal income taxes has doubled, because of Donald Trump's tax giveaways to the rich and large corporations. Nothing in federal income taxes.That is a disgrace."
720,Sanders,"Trump's NAFTA 2.0 is filled with giveaways for Big Pharma and major corporations. We need trade agreements that build an inclusive economy for all, not just the 1%."
721,Sanders,"The Trump administration keeps lying. They want to throw 32 million people off insurance, end protections for pre-existing conditions and raise premiums. Here's the truth about Medicare for All: It means never having to worry about being able to afford the health care you need."
722,Sanders,34 millones de estadounidenses no tienen seguro m√©dico y miles mueren cada a√±o porque no pueden pagar servicios m√©dicos. Estamos introduciendo #MedicareForAll para que cada estadounidense pueda recibir la atenci√≥n m√©dica que necesita.
723,Sanders,"I'm proud to introduce the Medicare for All Act of 2019.It's simple: No deductibles, no surprise bills for out-of-network services, and no copays. And if you change jobs, no changing insurance plans or worrying about losing the coverage that you and your family depend on."
724,Sanders,"If every major country on the planet can guarantee health care to all and achieve better health outcomes, while spending less per capita, please do not tell us that the United States of America cannot do the same. If we were to pass #MedicareForAll tomorrow, lives would be saved."
725,Sanders,"34 million Americans do not have health insurance, and thousands die each year because they cannot afford medical care. Today we reintroduced #MedicareForAll so that every American can get the health care they need."
726,Sanders,"Let's make history. Let's bring an end to a system that allowed 5 insurance corporations to make $20 billion in profits last year, while 1 in 5 Americans could not afford their prescriptions. Let's pass #MedicareForAll.Watch live now: https://t.co/TerdPzVcIm"
727,Sanders,"We all want a strong defense, but the United States should not be spending $733 billion on the military ‚Äì more than the next 10 countries combined. We should be investing in education and infrastructure, not endless wars."
728,Sanders,"Tomorrow, I'm introducing the Medicare for All Act of 2019.-70% of Americans support it-More than a dozen Senate co-sponsors-Endorsed by more than 50 nat'l orgs-Covers long-term services, ensuring care for people with disabilitiesHealth care is a RIGHT, not a privilege."
729,Sanders,Tax Day is around the corner and guess what? Corporations are lobbying for a new law that would prevent the government from offering you a free and easy online way to pay your taxes. The system is rigged and we need to drastically change it to protect the public.
730,Sanders,"Hey Mr. President, take your absurd ideas on climate change solutions and put them back where they came from."
731,Sanders,Congress made history this week by passing my resolution with @SenMikeLee to cut off U.S. support for Saudi-led forces in the civil war in Yemen.
732,Sanders,Today we passed an historic war powers resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Watch our press conference live
733,Sanders,Today we took a clear stand against war and famine and for Congress‚Äô war powers by voting to end our complicity in the war in Yemen. This is just the beginning of a national debate over when and where we go to war and Congress‚Äô authority over those interventions.
734,Sanders,"The House will vote soon on our resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Trump has said he opposes ""endless wars."" He can show us he means it by signing this resolution when it comes to his desk."
735,Sanders,No American should have to go without basic health care. Community health centers are a critical lifeline for millions of Americans. @WhipClyburn and I are working to expand them to everyone who needs care.
736,Sanders,We have a crisis in primary health care. @WhipClyburn and I are introducing legislation to fix it and provide health care to millions of Americans.
737,Sanders,I frankly do not understand why Republicans seem to hate providing health care to the American people.
738,Sanders,Next week the House will vote on our resolution to end US support for the Yemen war. I urge my House colleagues to reject any effort to undermine the resolution with a motion to recommit. It‚Äôs time to pass this resolution and send it to the president.
739,Sanders,"Do you want to know what's crazy? Last year, Amazon and Netflix, to name a couple companies, paid no federal income taxes after making billions in profits."
740,Sanders,"Over a year after Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is still struggling to recover. It is unconscionable that Trump has allowed our fellow citizens to suffer for so long. To the people of Puerto Rico: you are not forgotten. We will do everything we possibly can to rebuild the island."
741,Sanders,"The Sackler family has made billions of dollars selling opioids. Their greed, which is killing Americans, must end."
742,Sanders,"The Senate Republican Budget: - Throws 32 million off healthcare - Cuts Medicare and Medicaid - Kicks 175,000 kids off Head Start - Denies nutrition assistance to 5 million pregnant moms and babies - Provides more tax breaks to the Top 1%"
743,Sanders,"Mitch McConnell and the Republican Party don't believe we have to address climate change, the major crisis facing this planet. That is a disgrace. We need a Green New Deal that says we are going to boldly confront climate change and create millions of jobs in the process."
744,Sanders,"Over 30,000 Americans could die every single year if Trump gets his way and destroys the Affordable Care Act. Our job is to fight back against his efforts to take health care away from millions of people. We must make health care a right through Medicare for All."
745,Sanders,Discrimination has no place in our society. I am proud to display this flag as a symbol of my support for transgender people across the country. We must stand with transgender people in all of our communities.
746,Sanders,Puerto Rico is in dire need of increased food assistance funding.It's unconscionable that we've allowed our fellow Americans to suffer for so long without the full resources of the U.S. government. We must act now to end this crisis.
747,Sanders,I'm proud to stand in solidarity with the employees at Ford GoBike in San Francisco who are voting to join the Transport Workers Union on March 28th. We cannot have a strong and vibrant middle class without a strong and vibrant trade union movement.
748,Sanders,"I‚Äôm proud to stand in solidarity with 1,500 grad workers at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) who are on strike for a living wage. I say to UIC: Sit down at the bargaining table. Negotiate in good faith. Pay your workers a living"
749,Sanders,"While Trump provided a trillion dollar tax giveaway to the top 1% and profitable corporations, his budget would deny high-quality childcare and early childhood education to nearly 150,000 kids by cutting Head Start by $7.6 billion over the next ten years."
750,Sanders,"Trump's budget would take away nutrition assistance from more than 1 million pregnant women, infants and children by cutting the WIC program by $5.8 billion over the next decade. We must defeat this cruel budget."
751,Sanders,"I voted against the war in Iraq. Sadly, much of what I feared in fact did happen. I don't want to see it happen again."
752,Sanders,"16 years ago, the United States invaded Iraq. I opposed it at the time, warning of unintended consequences. We are still dealing with those disastrous consequences today and will be for many years. We need a foreign policy that focuses on diplomacy, not war."
753,Sanders,Trump‚Äôs proposed increase in base Pentagon spending could make public colleges and universities tuition-free over the next decade.
754,Sanders,"Today‚Äôs vote is about much more than a wall or whether there is a national emergency on the southern border. There is not.It's about whether we are a nation of laws, where the president obeys the Constitution and democratic processes. We will not become an authoritarian nation."
755,Sanders,"Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply for a paid internship in Senator Sanders' Burlington and Washington, D.C. offices. Applications are due at 11:59 pm on Saturday,"
756,Sanders,"Trump‚Äôs budget pays for his huge tax break to the top one percent by cutting $1.5 trillion from Medicaid, $845 billion from Medicare and $25 billion from Social Security. That is unacceptable."
757,Sanders,"In an historic vote, the Senate sent an important message: we will no longer support Saudi Arabia in causing the worst humanitarian disaster on the planet. Congress will reassert its constitutional authority on issues of war and end U.S. support for the war in Yemen."
758,Sanders,"This is historic. For the first time in 45 years, Congress is one step closer to withdrawing U.S. forces from an unauthorized war. We must end the war in Yemen."
759,Sanders,The war in Yemen is both a humanitarian and a strategic disaster. Let us bring this catastrophic and unconstitutional war in Yemen to an end today.
760,Sanders,Climate change is the existential crisis of our time. Why isn't this something we talk about on the news every day?
761,Sanders,This is very good news. We can't properly reform our broken criminal justice system without ending the death penalty. We must abolish the death penalty once and for all.
762,Sanders,"Yemen is experiencing the worst humanitarian disaster in the world due to the Saudi-led war. The U.S. has been Saudi Arabia's partner in this horrific war. Too often, our weapons are being used to kill civilians. Today, the Senate can take a major step toward ending this war."
763,Sanders,Wealth inequality in America is at an all-time high. It's time we make millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share.
764,Sanders,Donald Trump's budget is not only an absolute disaster ‚Äì full of ideas that the American people have already rejected ‚Äì it exposes Trump for the fraud that he is.
765,Sanders,"85,000 children have starved to death in Yemen as a result of the Saudi-led war.U.S. participation in this war has not been authorized by Congress and is therefore unconstitutional.Tomorrow the Senate will vote to end U.S. support for this disastrous and unconstitutional war."
766,Sanders,"Medicaid covers nearly half of all births in the U.S.But Donald Trump wants to cut Medicaid by $1.5 trillion.Our job: Stop Trump's cruel budget and guarantee health care to every woman, man and child in this country, not throw more people off the health care they have."
767,Sanders,"Without new funding, more than 1 million Puerto Ricans will be impacted by cuts to their food assistance. Congress must act immediately to end this humanitarian crisis."
768,Sanders,Amazon must recognize that workers' rights don't stop at the minimum wage. Amazon must significantly improve working conditions at its warehouses and respect the constitutional right of its employees to form a union and bargain collectively for a better life.
769,Sanders,We spend more on the military than the next 10 countries combined. Now Trump is proposing an $861 billion increase in base defense spending over 10 years. And he wants to pay for it by cutting over $1 trillion from programs working families depend on. That is a disgrace.
770,Sanders,Trump's budget is breathtaking in its cruelty. It cuts:- $1.5 trillion from Medicaid- $845 billion from Medicare- $25 billion from Social SecurityThis budget does the exact opposite of what Trump promised the American people.
771,Sanders,"This is a budget for the military-industrial complex, for corporate CEOs, for Wall Street and for the billionaire class. We don‚Äôt need billions of dollars for a wall that no one wants. We need a budget that works for all Americans, not just Trump and his billionaire friends."
772,Sanders,Climate change is the existential crisis of our time. Why isn't this something we talk about on the news every day?
773,Sanders,This is a long overdue rebuke from the United Nations Human Rights Council of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs atrocious record on human rights. The United States should put pressure on the Saudi regime to release imprisoned activists and end its persecution of
774,Sanders,"Puerto Rico needs food assistance funding due to the hurricanes which devastated the island. Some 1.4 million U.S. citizens will face large cuts to their food assistance benefits, 230,000 will lose the benefits entirely. We must act now to end this crisis."

778,Sanders,"In the United States, you should not be in danger of losing your home because you get sick. We need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower drug prices."
779,Sanders,"Today I introduced legislation with @NydiaVelazquez that would end unequal treatment of the territories, help Puerto Rico recover from the hurricanes and aid the most vulnerable in our society by providing sustainable economic relief going forward."
780,Sanders,"Medicare for All is the only solution to our current wasteful, for-profit health care system."
781,Sanders,"Congratulations to @BobbyScott and every Democrat on the @EdLaborCmte for passing legislation to raise the federal minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to a living wage of $15 an hour.A job should lift Americans out of poverty, not keep them in it."

783,Sanders,40% of fast-food workers have reported experiencing sexual harassment. That is simply unacceptable.We must stand with the brave McDonald‚Äôs workers protesting today to demand the company address this epidemic of sexual harassment.
784,Sanders,"American troops have been in Afghanistan for nearly 18 years, Iraq since 2003 and in Syria since 2015.The American people do not want endless war. Congress must reassert its Constitutional authority over the use of force and responsibly end these interventions."
785,Sanders,"Americans are being forced to ration life-saving medication because Catalyst Pharmaceuticals raised the price of the drug from $0 to $375,000. That is unconscionable."
786,Sanders,"600,000 people, disproportionately people of color, were arrested for possession of marijuana in 2017.It is time to decriminalize marijuana, expunge past marijuana convictions and end the failed war on drugs."
787,Sanders,My friend @RepRoKhanna's excellent questioning of Michael Cohen confirmed that the president is very likely a criminal.
788,Sanders,"Today‚Äôs House Oversight hearing with Michael Cohen confirms what we already knew: the president is a liar, a racist, and very likely a criminal."
789,Sanders,I hope we will soon vote on this common-sense bill in the Senate and start to stem the tide of gun violence in this country.
790,Sanders,5 states have now passed legislation increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour. I congratulate the Vermont Senate for doing the same. Let's make sure every worker in Vermont and throughout the country has the right to a living wage.
791,Sanders,Wabtec provided some $60 million in payments to the company's 20 top executives as a result of its merger with GE but is now trying to force workers into 12 hour shifts without overtime pay. That is outrageous. I stand with UE Local 506 and 618.
792,Sanders,"While health insurance and drug companies make billions in profits, thousands of Americans die each year because they lack access to health care.We must make health care a right, not a privilege. Thank you @RepJayapal for helping to lead the effort to pass Medicare for All."

794,Sanders,"No surprise. Insurance and drug companies oppose Medicare for All. They make billions in profits from our dysfunctional system and pay their CEOs outrageous amounts.But we have the people on our side. They understand we must guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege."
795,Sanders,"The people of Venezuela are enduring a serious humanitarian crisis. The Maduro government must put the needs of its people first, allow humanitarian aid into the country, and refrain from violence against protesters."
796,Sanders,".@UEUnion workers from #UE506 line up to vote to authorize a strike if necessary as negotiations with Wabtec breakdown. At stake: weekends, family sustaining wages, job security and 80 years of workers‚Äô rights. I stand with #UE506 and working Americans everywhere."
797,Sanders,This new rule is a disgraceful assault on women's right and an assault on millions of Americans' ability to get the health care they need. Title X funds provide much-needed family planning services for millions of people. Congress must take action to overturn the final rule.
798,Sanders,"Combined 2018 profit of Amazon, GM, Netflix &amp; Goodyear: $24.5 billionFederal income taxes paid: $0Combined federal tax refund: $275 millionOur job: Repeal all of the Trump tax giveaways to the top 1 percent and large corporations and rebuild the disappearing middle class."
799,Sanders,"This drug was free for patients just weeks ago. Now, patients around the country are rationing their medication because they have no idea how they will afford it. Meanwhile, Catalyst Pharmaceuticals is set to make hundreds of millions of dollars off their suffering."
800,Sanders,"I'm proud to stand in solidarity with the 1,700 locomotive manufacturing workers in Erie, Pennsylvania, who are fighting to keep the pay and benefits they have won as members of the UE union. Corporate executives must not use the merger between GE and Wabtec to hurt workers."
801,Sanders,"Catalyst's decision to raise the price of a life-saving drug from $0 to $375,000 is causing patients to suffer and ration their medication. Outrageous!Catalyst must immediately lower the price of Firdapse."
802,Sanders,"Why does Trump want to repeal the estate tax? Maybe because without it, a majority of the assets held by households worth $100 million or more would never be taxed. We must reduce inequality, not make it worse. Our job is to increase the estate tax on billionaires like Trump."
803,Sanders,"Artificial intelligence and robotics are positive creations of the human mind. They should be used to improve the lives of working people, not just to increase corporate profits.  Human beings must control technology, not the other way around."
804,Sanders,"Before Social Security was created in 1932, about half of seniors lived in poverty. Today, the senior poverty rate is just 8.8% and in 2016 Social Security lifted 22 million Americans out of poverty. Our job is not to cut Social Security. Our job is to expand it."
805,Sanders,".@billmckibben, a fellow Vermonter, is a great environmental leader. He is an outstanding writer and organizer. Thanks to Bill, and other leading environmentalists, more and more Americans are fighting to save our planet. Thanks, Bill."
806,Sanders,Trump and his friends believe in voter suppression and billionaires buying elections. We want:‚úÖ Automatic voter registration‚úÖ The overturn of Citizens United‚úÖ Election day as a national holiday  History is on our side. We will win this struggle.
807,Sanders,Let me congratulate the @fightfor15 movement for winning another historic victory.The American people understand that we must raise the federal minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to a living wage ‚Äì at least $15 an hour. And that is exactly what we'll do!
808,Sanders,"The current fight in DC is about more than a wall. It's about whether we are a nation of laws, where the president obeys the Constitution and democratic processes. The American people must inform Trump that we will not become an authoritarian nation."
809,Sanders,"Donald Trump may not like it, but we are not an authoritarian country. We have a constitution and separation of powers. There is no ""national emergency,"" and Trump cannot build his wall without congressional approval."
810,Sanders,"The American people, the Congress and the courts must show Trump what the Constitution and separation of powers is about. Trump cannot declare a ""national emergency"" whenever he wants, and spend money on his pet project. Not gonna happen!"
811,Sanders,"If you paid the $119 annual fee to become an Amazon Prime member, you paid more to Amazon than it paid in taxes. Our job: Repeal all of the Trump tax breaks for the top 1% and large corporations and demand that they pay their fair share in taxes."
812,Sanders,"While I have concerns about this bill, I supported it because I can‚Äôt turn my back on the 2 million federal employees and private contractors who would be forced again to work without pay. I am also concerned about the millions who would be denied access to government services."
813,Sanders,"There is not a ""national emergency"" with regard to the southern border. What President Trump is doing is unlawful and must be opposed vigorously in the courts and legislatively."
814,Sanders,"The great economic crisis we face is the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality. When so few have so much, and so many have so little, a handful of billionaires end up controlling our economic and political life. That has got to change."
815,Sanders,Today we remember the Parkland students and teachers who lost their lives.Thank you to the young people who have courageously led the movement to end gun violence. With your leadership and the strong support of the American people we will pass commonsense gun safety legislation
816,Sanders,I applaud my House colleagues for today‚Äôs historic passage of HJ Res 37 ‚Äì ending U.S. support for the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. The Senate must quickly pass this resolution and finally reassert Congress' constitutional authority over war.
817,Sanders,Amazon made $16.8 billion in profits over the past two years but have paid ZERO in federal income taxes. In fact it got a $269 million tax refund.Our job: Demand large corporations pay their fair share in taxes so that we can rebuild the disappearing middle class.
818,Sanders,The only way we will pass a Green New Deal and take the bold action required to combat climate change is if millions of young people stand up and demand that we rapidly transform our energy system away from fossil fuels.Thank you @sunrisemvmt for helping to lead the movement.
819,Sanders,"I will vote against William Barr‚Äôs nomination. I cannot support someone for attorney general who will not make public the full Mueller report, who opposes a woman‚Äôs right to control her own body and who supports the failed war on drugs. Mr. Barr‚Äôs nomination must be defeated."
820,Sanders,Donald Trump made $694 million in 2016. That means he stopped paying Social Security taxes 40 minutes into the year.Meanwhile a middle-class worker paid Social Security taxes the entire year.I say to Trump: pay your fair share. Let's scrap the cap and expand Social Security.
821,Sanders,"At a time when half of older Americans have zero retirement savings, we are not going to cut Social Security, as my Republican colleagues have proposed. We are going to expand Social Security and ensure everyone can retire with dignity. #ScrapTheCap"
822,Sanders,"The American people understand that a moral society doesn't give tax breaks to billionaires and then cut back on the needs of seniors or people with disabilities, as our Republican colleagues have proposed.Today, I am introducing legislation to expand Social Security."
823,Sanders,"It is not too much to demand that in our democracy, everyone 18 years of age should be automatically registered to vote. End of discussion."
824,Sanders,We have got to end the embarrassment of being the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee paid leave. #FAMILYAct
825,Sanders,"Our health care system today essentially says that if you happen to be poor, you are less deserving of getting care than a wealthy person. That is fundamentally immoral and that is not the kind of nation we should be."
826,Sanders,"Too many seniors are living in desperate poverty, unable to afford their medicine or basic needs. Many Republicans want to cut Social Security benefits. That's wrong. We need to expand them. Tomorrow, I will be outlining my plan to do that."
827,Sanders,"How is it that in the richest country in the history of the world, we can't afford to pay everyone a living wage? It's time to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour."
828,Sanders,"If Trump shuts down the government again, planes may not be flying. The Association of Flight Attendants believes that another shutdown would threaten the safety and security of airline passengers and employees. No more shutdowns!"
829,Sanders,What kind of economy allows for the top 0.00025% of the population to own more wealth than the bottom 150 million? A rigged economy.That is why we demand that the very wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share in taxes.
830,Sanders,"Today in 1922, researchers at the University of Toronto announced the discovery of insulin. They sold the patent for $1 so it would be available to all.97 years later, Eli Lilly is charging ~$300 and Americans die because they can‚Äôt afford their medication. Outrageous."
831,Sanders,Watch this progressive economist @lenorepalladino explain to Trump's chief economist how large corporations use stock buybacks to enrich their shareholders at the expense of workers.
832,Sanders,"Our infrastructure is collapsing, our health care system is dysfunctional, our political system is corrupt and we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. And Trump spends most of his time talking about a wall. It's time for a real change."
833,Sanders,"In the richest country in the world, our teachers should be the best-paid, not among the worst-paid. I stand with Denver teachers. We must invest in public education because our students and teachers deserve better. #DenverTeacherStrike"
834,Sanders,"75 years ago, FDR talked about the need to guarantee every person in this country a good job as a fundamental right. That was true in 1944. It is true today."
835,Sanders,"Trump gave the top 1% and large corporations $1 trillion in tax breaks.  Now, he wants to repeal the Estate Tax and make his billionaire friends even richer. Wrong! At a time of massive wealth inequality, the very rich must pay their fair share of taxes."
836,Sanders,We can no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that have been rigged to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else.
837,Sanders,"Trump is worried about America becoming a ""socialist nation."" That is exactly what Republicans said about Social Security in 1935 and what they said about Medicare in 1965. Guess what? These are the two most popular programs in the country."
838,Sanders,"What if, instead giving tax breaks to billionaires and massive corporations, we gave 40 million Americans a raise by making the federal minimum wage a living wage of $15 an hour?"
839,Sanders,"Donald Trump rants against undocumented immigrants, and wants to spend billions on a wall to keep them out. Yet, surprise, surprise. Trump's golf clubs and resorts have knowingly hired low-wage undocumented workers for years. What a fraud!"
840,Sanders,"While psychologists tell us that ages 0-4 are the most important years of human development, we have a dysfunctional childcare system which underpays staff and is too costly for working families. We need universal, publicly funded"
841,Sanders,The U.S. is the most powerful economy on earth and we must lead the world in the fight against climate change. We can do that by passing the Green New Deal to save the planet and create millions of new jobs.
842,Sanders,"Under billionaire Eddie Lampert's watch 3,500 Sears stores closed and over 250,000 workers lost their jobs. Lampert must ensure a just transition for Sears workers who lost their jobs due to his greed. Workers deserve severance pay and to have their benefits honored."
843,Sanders,Fighting for Medicare for all will mean taking on special interests who will spend enormous sums of money to defend our dysfunctional health care system. They have the money. We have the people.
844,Sanders,"The American people are tired of a health care system that works for Wall Street investors, insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry‚Äîbut ignores their needs. They want to move to a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system."
845,Sanders,President Trump believes we should listen to fossil fuel executives and ignore climate change. I believe we should listen to the scientists who tell us we must aggressively combat climate change and transform our energy system to sustainable energy.
846,Sanders,"Where did the money from Trump's ""tax cuts for the middle class"" go? To wealthy corporations who have spent $1 trillion buying back their own stock to enrich executives and wealthy shareholders. That's not acceptable."
847,Sanders,"Republicans want to cut taxes for Trump's kids and other children of billionaire families. No. It's time to enact a progressive estate tax and start investing in programs that actually help working families, not the top 0.2%."
848,Sanders,"Trump's demonization of Latinos is racist, it‚Äôs wrong and it also happens to be factually inaccurate. Undocumented Latino immigrants commit fewer crimes in America than the general public."
849,Sanders,I agree with the joint statement from the Virginia House and Senate Democrats. Very serious and credible allegations have been made by two women against Lieutenant Governor Fairfax. He needs to resign.
850,Sanders,"President Trump. Do not shut down the government again. Another Trump shutdown would be not only harmful to our federal workers, but also to the safety and security of our nation."
851,Sanders,"Donald Trump‚Äôs relentless attacks on our political institutions not only undermine our democracy, they also embolden authoritarian leaders around the world."
852,Sanders,"I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal proposal. We must address the existential crisis of planetary climate change, while at the same time creating millions of good-paying jobs in our country."
853,Sanders,"Trump's top intelligence officials, European allies, national security and nonproliferation experts: The Iran nuclear deal works.Trump: No."
854,Sanders,Climate change is an existential disaster facing the entire world. We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. A Green New Deal can save the planet and create millions of new jobs.
855,Sanders,"No one, not even the president of the United States, is above the law."
856,Sanders,"Mr. Trump, you are dead wrong. This is not a ""hot economy"" when 62 percent of jobs in America cannot support a middle class life."
857,Sanders,Millions of our people are working for starvation wages. Here is the simple truth. Nobody can raise a family or pay the rent on poverty wages of $8 or $9 an hour.We are the wealthiest country in the world. We can do better. We can raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
858,Sanders,"Yes, the economy is great‚Äîfor the top 1 percent, who now earn 46 percent of all new income. Not for the nearly 80 percent of Americans living paycheck to paycheck."
859,Sanders,"""Our progress has always found refuge in the basic instinct of the American experiment‚Äîto do right by our people. And with a renewed commitment to social and economic justice, we will create a stronger America together."" ‚Äì@staceyabrams"
860,Sanders,"Trump talks a lot about ""freedom."" But people are not truly free when they have no health care or can't afford to feed their families. They are not free when they must work 80 hours a week on starvation wages."
861,Sanders,"We have got to think big, not small. Canada guarantees free health care for all, Finland provides free tuition at public colleges, France provides generous retirement benefits. We are the wealthiest country on Earth. Why can't we do the same?"
862,Sanders,"All Americans have a right to breathe clean air and drink clean water. Yet Andrew Wheeler, Trump's nominee to lead the EPA, won't commit to regulating a family of toxic chemicals found in our drinking water."
863,Sanders,"One vial of insulin cost $21 in 1996, compared to $320 in 2018. American lives are being lost because of pharma's greed. That has got to end."
864,Sanders,"Tonight, Trump repeated some of the most extreme anti-women attacks coming from the far right. At a time when we see an unprecedented and coordinated attack against a woman‚Äôs right to choose, we must fight to make sure that every woman has the right to control her own body. #SOTU"
865,Sanders,"If we are serious about transforming our country, rebuilding the middle class and reinvigorating our democracy: let us bring our people together to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation. #SOTU"
866,Sanders,"Trump said tonight, ‚ÄúWe are born free, and we will stay free.‚ÄùI say to Trump: People are not truly free when they can‚Äôt afford health care, prescription drugs, or a place to live. People are not free when they cannot retire with dignity or feed their families. #SOTU"
867,Sanders,Tonight Trump‚Äîwho in less than two years in the White House has seen 5 aides either plead guilty or be convicted of criminal charges‚Äîclaimed the strength of the economy was dependent on him being free from necessary oversight and investigations. The exact opposite is true. #SOTU
868,Sanders,How can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change? #SOTU
869,Sanders,"Despite what President Trump says, it is not ‚Äúa hot economy‚Äù when 43% of households can't afford to pay for housing, food, child care, health care, transportation and a cell phone without going into debt. That is not a hot economy. #SOTU"
870,Sanders,My response to President Trump‚Äôs State of the Union address:
871,Sanders,"Now that that‚Äôs over, please watch my friend Stacey Abrams share her message for the country."
872,Sanders,Fox News can't believe their own poll says people want to tax the rich. The truth is: The overwhelming majority of the American people want the wealthy to pay their fair share.
873,Sanders,"Let me guess. President Trump tonight will talk about crimes committed by undocumented Latinos. Do you think he will mention the mass shootings done by white men, or the need for common sense gun safety legislation?"
874,Sanders,Will Trump talk about climate change in his State of the Union address tonight?
875,Sanders,"Lloyd Blankfein, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, is correct that the money from stock buybacks ‚Äúdoesn't vanish.‚Äù It increases the wealth of billionaires like him. Instead of making the very rich even richer, how about increasing wages for American workers. Is that a bad idea?"
876,Sanders,"Today, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major nation, our child care system is dysfunctional, our teachers are underpaid and many public schools are struggling. We need to invest in our kids, not a wall with Mexico."
877,Sanders,Republicans officials don't push the myth of voter fraud because it is an actual problem. They push it to maintain the racist voting laws that have kept them in power for generations. The real problem we face is voter
878,Sanders,It was a Republican president ‚Äî not Bernie Sanders ‚Äî who first argued for the creation of a progressive estate tax to reduce the enormous concentration of wealth. Mitch McConnell might want to listen.
879,Sanders,Congratulations to New Jersey and @GovMurphy for signing a bill today to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Now we must ensure a livable wage in all 50 states.
880,Sanders,.@SenSchumer and I are here to say: corporations must address the needs of workers before the interests of wealthy stockholders. Our bill will prohibit corporations from buying back stock unless they invest in workers and communities first.
881,Sanders,"Instead of wasting billions on a wall with Mexico, tax breaks for billionaires and a bloated military budget, we need to end childhood poverty, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, combat climate change and invest in our kids and seniors."
882,Sanders,"Today on Rosa Parks' 106th birthday we must do more than just remember her lifetime of organizing. We must honor her by working to fulfill her vision of racial, economic and social justice."
883,Sanders,"Stacey Abrams is a great choice to deliver the Democratic response. I'm very much looking forward to her speech.For the third year in a row, following the Democratic rebuttal I'll be on Facebook Live, Twitter and YouTube to respond to Trump."
884,Sanders,"Walmart‚Äôs decision to provide 48 hours of paid sick leave to some employees is a small step forward, but not nearly good enough. This is not a poor company. Walmart can and must pay all of its workers at least $15 an hour with good benefits."
885,Sanders,"Three people own more wealth than the bottom half of our country. 25 hedge fund managers earn twice as much as all 140,000 kindergarten teachers. One family (Kochs) spent $400 million to buy elections. That's why we need a political revolution."
886,Sanders,I stand with @transportworker fighting to keep us safe and to keep airline mechanics jobs in America.
887,Sanders,"Instead of repealing the estate tax and giving a massive tax cut to the Walton family and Kochs as Mitch McConnell and Trump want to do, let‚Äôs substantially increase this tax on multi-millionaires and billionaires and reduce wealth inequality in America."
888,Sanders,"Walmart is spending $20 billion on a share repurchase program.With a fraction of that amount, Walmart could have raised hourly wages of every employee to $15.Corporations should address the needs of workers before the interests of wealthy stockholders."
889,Sanders,"Today, I am demanding that Catalyst explain why they raised the price of this drug by $375,000. No one in the United States of America should die because they cannot afford the medication they need."
890,Sanders,"Catalyst Pharmaceuticals raised the price of a life-saving drug from $0 to $375,000.Now patients are worried they are going to suffer or even die because of the greed of a drug company.If Catalyst does not substantially lower the price of this medication, Congress must act."
891,Sanders,Let's not kid ourselves. What we have today is a campaign finance system that amounts to legalized bribery.
892,Sanders,"Remember when Trump promised that his tax giveaway to the rich would put an extra $4,000 into the pockets of middle-class families?The reality: bonuses for average workers are up by just two cents an hour since Trump‚Äôs tax plan was signed into law. Two cents."
893,Sanders,Every other major country has made the morally principled and financially responsible decision to make health care a right to all of their people. Those who say this goal is unachievable are selling the American people short.
894,Sanders,Gov. Northam should resign. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax should step in and begin a new day for Virginia.
895,Sanders,"After 35 days of pain and suffering for federal workers and contractors during the Trump shutdown, what's the first thing that the GOP leadership decides to do? Make the wealthiest families in America even richer."
896,Sanders,"Trump‚Äôs withdrawal from the INF treaty is dangerous and irresponsible. We should strengthen these treaties, not end them. We should invest in our children, our seniors and our working families, not in an incredibly expensive arms race."
897,Sanders,"The grotesque level of wealth inequality, from a moral, economic and political perspective, is the great challenge we face. We cannot have a vibrant democracy or a just economy when so few have so much, and so many have so little."
898,Sanders,"Pharma companies lied about the addictive impacts of opioids, yet not one of them has been held fully accountable for this crisis.We have got to start punishing their greed and recklessness which is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year."
899,Sanders,Trump and McConnell believe‚Äîat a time of obscene inequality‚Äîthat they need to help out the richest 0.2% of Americans by repealing the estate tax.I have a better idea: raise the estate tax so that billionaires pay their fair share.
900,Sanders,"Under billionaire Eddie Lampert's watch 3,500 Sears stores closed and over 250,000 workers lost their jobs. Lampert must ensure a just transition for Sears workers who lost their jobs due to his greed. Workers deserve severance pay and to have their benefits honored."
901,Sanders,"The American people do not want endless war. It is the job of Congress to responsibly end these military interventions and bring our troops home, not to come up with more reasons to continue them."
902,Sanders,"According to my Republican colleague, corporations are people who can have unlimited influence in our elections. But if you're a low-income worker in Kentucky, we shouldn't make it any easier for you to vote."
903,Sanders,"Our infrastructure is collapsing. Teachers are underpaid. Veterans sleep on the streets. Families can't afford child care.But, according to my Republican colleagues, one of our highest priorities must be to give hundreds of billions of dollars to a few billionaire families."
904,Sanders,It is not just a coincidence that 46% of all new income is going to the top 1%. That is the result of an economy that is rigged in favor of the wealthy.
905,Sanders,"I say to Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump: Instead of repealing the estate tax, let‚Äôs substantially increase this tax on multi-millionaires and billionaires and reduce wealth inequality in America."
906,Sanders,"Incredibly, Republican leaders in the Senate have introduced a bill to repeal the estate tax for the richest 1,700 families in America. That's absurd.From a moral, economic and political perspective our nation will not thrive when so few have so much and so many have so little."
907,Sanders,Our bill only applies to the richest 0.2% of Americans. It would establish a:-45% tax on estate values $3.5M to $10M-50% tax on estate values $10M to $50M-55% tax on estate values over $50M-77% tax on estate values over $1 billion
908,Sanders,"The fairest way to reduce wealth inequality, invest in the disappearing middle class and preserve our democracy is to enact a progressive estate tax on the inherited wealth of multi-millionaires and billionaires.Today I'm introducing a bill to do"
909,Sanders,"Somehow, we have billions of dollars available for more jails and incarceration, but we ""can't afford"" to provide kids with the college education they need to survive in modern America. That doesn't make any sense to me."
910,Sanders,"Billionaires and huge corporations should not be allowed to use loopholes and tax havens to avoid paying their fair share. At a time of massive global inequality the very wealthy should be paying more in taxes, not less."
911,Sanders,"When Yemenis see ‚ÄúMade in USA‚Äù on the bombs that are killing them, it tells them that the USA is responsible for this war.This is not the message we should be sending to the world. Congress must end support for the catastrophic war in Yemen led by a despotic Saudi regime."
912,Sanders,"The Saudi-led war in Yemen has been a humanitarian and strategic disaster. 85,000 children have starved to death. Today my colleagues and I are reintroducing our resolution to end U.S. support for this war and reclaim our constitutional authority."
913,Sanders,"After Trump shut down the government for 35 days the first bill Sen. McConnell introduced wasn't to provide back-pay to 1.2 million federal contractors.It wasn't to guarantee health care or lower drug prices.It was to repeal the estate tax for the 1,700 wealthiest families."
914,Sanders,The racist and homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is a horrific instance of the surging hostility toward minorities around the country. We must come together to eradicate all forms of bigotry and violence.
915,Sanders,We have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax-dodging for large corporations and the world's wealthiest individuals. It is time to end these egregious loopholes and make the wealthy pay their fair share.
916,Sanders,"Ending the estate tax would give a tax break of up to $63 billion to the Walton family and $39 billion to the Kochs‚Äîbut $0 to 99.8% of Americans.At a time of record inequality, the very last thing we should do is line the pockets of the"
917,Sanders,"This billionaire thinks a high marginal tax rate on the rich has never worked in any country, ever. Has he heard of the United States of America?"
918,Sanders,"Trump on his tax cuts: ""It‚Äôs gonna be a tremendous thing for the American people. It‚Äôs gonna be fantastic for the economy.""The reality: A windfall for massive corporations and billionaires. No major impact on job growth or investments in the US economy."
919,Sanders,"If we think big, not small, we can end the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality, guarantee health care for all, have a livable minimum wage and make public colleges and universities tuition-free. The struggle continues."
920,Sanders,"While I do not support the BDS movement, we must defend every American‚Äôs constitutional right to peacefully engage in political activity. It is clear to me that S.1 would violate Americans‚Äô First Amendment rights."
921,Sanders,As a nation we have a choice: are we going to join every other major country and make health care a right? Or will we continue to allow insurance and pharma companies to make huge profits off of people's suffering?
922,Sanders,I do not believe that men and women fought and died for our right to vote so that billionaires could buy elections. We must move to real campaign finance reform and public funding of elections.
923,Sanders,"In the year 2019, no one in America, especially those working for profitable corporations with billionaire CEOs, should be living in poverty or struggling economically.We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage‚Äî$15 an hour."
924,Sanders,"Mr. President. 800,000 federal employees and their families are human beings, not your play things. Do not treat them with contempt and disrupt their lives. They have kids. They have needs. Do not shut down the government again."
925,Sanders,"Our infrastructure is crumbling. Instead of building a wall on the Mexican border, we should create millions of good-paying jobs rebuilding our roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, schools, airports and affordable housing."
926,Sanders,"When an undocumented person commits a murder, Trump talks about it incessantly. When, in 2017,  a white guy like Stephen Paddock kills 58 people in Las Vegas and wounds 851, Trump has very little to say."
927,Sanders,"Today, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, we pledge to never forget the 6 million Jews murdered by Hitler. At a time of increased tribalism and  xenophobia, we must recommit ourselves to fight against all forms of bigotry and intolerance."
928,Sanders,"Young people all over the world are demanding action on climate change, like @GretaThunberg, who had the courage to demand that the world‚Äôs corporate elite do their part to address this global crisis."
929,Sanders,"Read this piece from @NickKristof about Saudi human rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul, who has been detained and tortured by the Saudi regime. The U.S. must push for rights activists to be freed and the regime held accountable."
930,Sanders,"At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, when the 3 wealthiest people own more wealth than the bottom half of our country and 46% of all new income goes to the top 1%, Americans want the rich to pay their fair share of"

932,Sanders,"Thank you air traffic controllers, flight attendants, federal workers and contract employees for standing up for your rights, holding rallies, organizing and sharing  heartbreaking stories over the past 35 days. You are the reason that the government shutdown finally ended."
933,Sanders,"President Trump shut down the government, held 800,000 federal employees hostage and disrupted vital federal services for absolutely nothing. Pathetic!"
934,Sanders,"How pathetic. On Dec. 19, the Senate unanimously passed essentially the same legislation that we will vote on today. We are back to exactly where we started. Thank you, Mr. President, for shutting down the government and holding 800,000 federal employees hostage. All for nothing!"
935,Sanders,"The Constitution and federal law bans indentured servitude. That means no worker, including federal employees, should be forced to work without getting paid. Trump's anti-worker government shutdown is an ugly attack on the working class of this country."
936,Sanders,"Mr. President. Your shutdown is not only hurting federal employees and people who need government services, it's now impacting the general public and the whole economy. End your shutdown now. Pay federal workers."
937,Sanders,"Today, six Republicans had the courage to stand up to Trump and vote with Democrats to end the shutdown without spending billions on an unneeded wall. The ball is now in Mitch McConnell's court. He must stand up to Trump and put federal employees back to work."
938,Sanders,"‚ÄúThey‚Äôre using us as a bargaining chip.‚Äù‚ÄúI feel as, I think many people do, a bit like a pawn.‚Äù‚ÄúHolding federal employees hostage is not the way to do it.‚ÄùPresident Trump, listen to federal workers. End the shutdown!"
939,Sanders,"But we must learn the lessons of the past and not be in the business of regime change or supporting coups‚Äîas we have in Chile, Guatemala, Brazil &amp; the DR. The US has a long history of inappropriately intervening in Latin American nations; we must not go down that road again. 3/3"
940,Sanders,"The United States should support the rule of law, fair elections and self-determination for the Venezuelan people. We must condemn the use of violence against unarmed protesters and the suppression of dissent. 2/3"
941,Sanders,"The Maduro government has waged a violent crackdown on Venezuelan civil society, violated the constitution by dissolving the National Assembly and was re-elected last year in an election many observers said was fraudulent. The economy is a disaster and millions are migrating. 1/3"
942,Sanders,"Once again, it is clear that a majority of Americans support an agenda which calls for economic justice. Increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour would give a pay raise to 40 million Americans. Let's do it."
943,Sanders,"The dangerous Line 3 pipeline in Minnesota would send a million barrels of tar sands oil‚Äîthe dirtiest fossil fuel in the world‚Äîthrough the headwaters of the Mississippi River, tribal treaty lands and sacred wild rice beds. It must be stopped. #StopLine3"
944,Sanders,"Trump‚Äôs shutdown is forcing furloughed workers to choose between paying for rent or chemotherapy.That is not a choice anyone in the wealthiest country in the history of the world should have to make.Mr. President, stop holding federal employees hostage. End the shutdown now."
945,Sanders,"Every two days last year, a multi-millionaire in the world became a billionaire. It's called a rigged global economy and this is how it works."
946,Sanders,"Billionaires like Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Trump may not get it, but It's not complicated. Federal employees go to food banks because they have to feed their kids, and they can't do that without a paycheck. Mr. President. End the shutdown you created."
947,Sanders,"President Trump, you want to talk about a crisis? 7 million Americans have become uninsured since you took office. The uninsured rate is the highest in 5 years.We must end the embarrassment of being the only major country not to guarantee health care for all. #MedicareForAll"
948,Sanders,"Trump stated loudly and clearly: ""I am proud to shut down the government."" Now, Mr. President, with 800,000 federal employees struggling to pay their bills, end the crisis you created. Pay federal employees. Open the government."
949,Sanders,Congratulations to LA teachers for leading this country forward to ensure that all our children get a quality education. When we stand together there is nothing we cannot accomplish.
950,Sanders,"The economy is ""booming"" for Trump and his billionaire golfing buddies at Mar-a-Lago, but for the 80 percent of workers who are living paycheck to paycheck, this is not an economy to be proud of."
951,Sanders,"If Trump were serious about protecting our national security, he would recognize that climate change is not a ""hoax"" and is already causing destruction and instability worldwide. The time for bold action is now."
952,Sanders,The bad news: We have just 11 years to take bold steps to rapidly transform our energy system to sustainable energy if the planet is going to remain habitable.The good news: We can revitalize our economy and create tens of millions of jobs in the process.
953,Sanders,"Today, 46 years after Roe v. Wade, abortion is a right in name only for millions of women in America. Our job: do everything we can to protect and expand reproductive rights and access to abortion across the country."
954,Sanders,Discrimination has no place in our military or society. It is my hope that this temporary ruling will not be the final outcome. We must stand with trans service members. Trump's efforts to divide us will not succeed.
955,Sanders,"We must stop incarcerating millions of Americans and funding militarism, and end racism in the criminal justice system and in the voting booth. Our attention should be on lifting up all Americans."
956,Sanders,"Trump says he supports the working class. Really? Today, as a result of his cruel government shutdown, 800,000 federal workers worry about how they will feed their kids, pay their mortgages or see a doctor. Mr. President. End the"
957,Sanders,"9 years ago the disastrous Citizens United decision opened the door for billionaires and corporate interests to buy our elections.To restore our one person, one vote democracy, we must pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and stop the slide to oligarchy."
958,Sanders,"We have a president who is a racist.Today we say to Trump: We aren't going back to more bigotry, discrimination and division. We're going forward."
959,Sanders,"In a democratic society, people can have honest differences of opinion. It is difficult, however, to engage in policy discussion with someone like Trump who is a pathological liar."
960,Sanders,"Dr. King's vision of ending the triple evils of racism, economic injustice and war is as important today as it was when Dr. King fought for those principles, and must motivate us in all of our work. #MLKDay"
961,Sanders,"We must do more than just ‚Äúhonor and remember‚Äù Dr. King. We must be faithful to his revolutionary spirit, his call for a ‚Äúradical revolution of values‚Äù and his incredible courage in taking on virtually the entire political and economic establishment of his time. #MLKDay"
962,Sanders,"Trump is shutting down the government not just for his absurd wall. When you don't pay 800,000 federal workers you are destroying the concept of government in a democratic society, and moving to more privatization and corporate control over our lives."
963,Sanders,"Interesting. Trump and Putin are not only billionaire, anti-democratic authoritarians but they deny the crisis of climate change and push fossil fuels. What's the connection?"
964,Sanders,"It is not a radical idea to say that instead of throwing millions of Americans off of the health care they have, we must join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare for All system."

966,Sanders,Mr. President. Stop holding federal employees hostage and stop holding the young people in DACA hostage. End the federal shutdown and reinstate legal status for these young Americans. #NoWall
967,Sanders,"No, President Trump, the economy is not ‚Äúabsolutely booming‚Äù when nearly 80 percent of workers live paycheck to paycheck. Instead of an agenda for the wealthy few, we need to create an economy that works for all of"
968,Sanders,"Since Trump was elected, the five richest people in America have seen their wealth go up by over $100 billion.Over the past year, wages for average workers are up by $9.11 a week after adjusting for inflation.That is the economic reality under Trump."
969,Sanders,"Instead of an austerity program for working families and the poor, we need austerity for billionaires and large multinational corporations."
970,Sanders,"President Trump said that ""nobody has been better at the military"" than him.So why is he keeping the government shut down and leaving 42,000 service members without paychecks for the first time in history?"
971,Sanders,"The wealth gap between white Americans and African Americans has more than TRIPLED over the past 50 years.Today, the median white family has almost 10 times as much wealth as the median black family.We must fight for racial and economic justice for all."
972,Sanders,"If this report is true, Donald Trump committed obstruction of justice‚Äîa felony and a potentially impeachable offense. I am glad that the House will be investigating this serious issue."
973,Sanders,"We must repeal the Trump tax breaks for the top 1% and large, profitable corporations. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create a sustainable economy, not make the very rich even richer."
974,Sanders,"Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has been hailed as a progressive reformer. But his track record of imprisoning, torturing and murdering activists begs to differ. It's time that the U.S. and the international community hold this despotic regime accountable."
975,Sanders,Congratulations to @GovMurphy and the New Jersey state legislature for agreeing to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. This is a major step forward for economic justice. Our job now: pass $15 minimum wage legislation for ALL Americans.
976,Sanders,"Maybe I‚Äôm the ‚Äúradical‚Äù one, but I don‚Äôt think it's acceptable that the top 25 Wall Street hedge fund managers made over $15 billion in compensation in 2017‚Äînearly double what all 140,000 kindergarten teachers in America made last year."
977,Sanders,"Over the past 40 years there has been an enormous transfer of income from the middle class to rich. Since 1979, the bottom 90% of Americans have seen their share of national income decline from 58% to just 46%‚Äîcosting them nearly $11,000 per household."
978,Sanders,"It is disgraceful that we have a president who is holding hostage the paychecks of 800,000 federal employees all because he didn't like being attacked by Fox News. Mr. President, end this dangerous shutdown now."
979,Sanders,"Yesterday Trump‚Äôs nominee to lead the EPA, Andrew Wheeler, wouldn't call climate change a crisis. And in his opening statement, he didn‚Äôt mention the words ""climate change"" once.We need an administration that leads the world in combatting climate change, not denies this crisis."
980,Sanders,"When we raise the minimum wage to a living wage, poverty will go down and new jobs will be created. This a win-win for the economy and our country. It's time to pass a $15 minimum wage."
981,Sanders,"The person Donald Trump has nominated to lead the Environmental Protection Agency doesn't believe climate change is a ""crisis."" That is not only a disgrace, it is incredibly dangerous to the future of our planet."
982,Sanders,"We need to change national priorities in this country. Instead of giving a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1 percent and large, profitable corporations, we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour."
983,Sanders,"Our $15 minimum wage bill would give a raise to over 40 million Americans, including more than half of African American and Latinx workers. A job should lift you out of poverty, not keep you in it. It's time every worker in America is paid a living wage."
984,Sanders,"Today, along with Rep. @BobbyScott and 181 House cosponsors and 31 Senate cosponsors, I'm announcing the Raise the Wage Act to bring the federal minimum wage up to $15 an hour.Watch our announcement live here:"
985,Sanders,"Trump thinks we have ""the greatest economy in the history of America."" It may be great for his friends at Mar-a-Lago, but:-The average worker makes less today than 43 years ago-80% live paycheck to paycheck-43% of households can't afford basic"
986,Sanders,"At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the wealthiest people in this country must start paying their fair share of taxes. And we must do away with the massive loopholes that allow profitable corporations to stash billions of dollars in tax havens overseas."
987,Sanders,Racism and white supremacy have no place in Vermont. Kiah Morris was an excellent representative and our state is worse off without her in office. We must root out racism in Vermont and ensure that no one fears for their safety because of the color of their skin.
988,Sanders,"On nearly every ""radical"" idea the American people are with us:72% want to expand Social Security.70% want Medicare for All.65% want a jobs guarantee.64% want to legalize marijuana.60% want tuition-free public colleges.58% want $15 min wage.57% want to break up big banks."
989,Sanders,"The scientists tell us that the future of the planet is endangered by climate change. Meanwhile, because of Trump's government shutdown, about 95% of E.P.A. employees have been furloughed because they are ""non-essential."" How insane is that?"
990,Sanders,"While labor productivity has more than doubled since the late 1960s, nearly half of all new income generated in the U.S. since 1993 has gone to the top 1 percent.This is what we mean when we say the economy is rigged in favor of the wealthy."
991,Sanders,"Think big, not small. It is not ""radical"" to demand that all Americans receive decent wages, guaranteed health care, quality education, affordable housing and a clean environment. We need a government that represents all of us, not just the 1%."
992,Sanders,"We need a revolution in education. Teachers in LA should not be forced to strike for decent wages and smaller classes. All parents deserve high quality, affordable childcare.  Young people should not leave college deeply in debt. We must get our priorities right."
993,Sanders,"The time has come to fulfill and expand upon FDR‚Äôs vision that he laid out in 1944.These are not radical ideas. They're supported by the majority of Americans. Working together, we can and we must achieve economic, social, racial, political and environmental justice for all."
994,Sanders,"Trump says the economy is ""booming."" It is‚Äîfor the top 10 CEOs who saw their combined compensation soar by 60% in 2017. For the average worker, however, real wages went up by just 1.2% over the past year. The very rich get richer. Working families continue to struggle."
995,Sanders,"""[The animals] are being taken care of better than we are."" ‚ÄìLarry Howard, a worker at the National Zoo who doesn't know how he is going to pay his bills during Trump's shutdown.Mr. President. Your actions have consequences. End your shutdown now and pay federal workers."
996,Sanders,"In America, a woman‚Äînot the government or her employer‚Äîmust control her own body. We must vigorously defend women‚Äôs access to all reproductive health services and allow them to make their own medical"
997,Sanders,Enough is enough.We are going to end the disgrace of health care being a privilege for the wealthy. We must pass Medicare for all and make health care a right.
998,Sanders,"The federal minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage. That is why I, along with many other members of Congress, will introduce legislation this week to raise that wage to $15 an hour. If you work 40 hours a week, you should not live in poverty."
999,Sanders,"Mr. President. Do you want to know what a real ""national emergency"" is? The scientists tell us that if we don't combat climate change aggressively, the severe damage done to our country and planet will be irreversible. Now that's a ""crisis."""
1000,Sanders,Do Trump and his billionaire friends understand that many federal employees live paycheck to paycheck? They have kids to feed and mortgages to pay.  Mr. President. Grow up. End the shutdown you created. Pay federal employees.
1001,Sanders,"Today, the top 0.1% owns more wealth than the bottom 90%.  Uncontrolled greed cannot be the driving force behind our economy.  Our job: demand that all Americans have good paying jobs, health care, quality education, and a healthy environment."
1002,Sanders,"Today, the 3 wealthiest Americans own more wealth than the bottom half of our people, and income and wealth inequality is worse now than at any time since the 1920s. This is a moral outrage and bad economics. Not acceptable."
1003,Sanders,"There‚Äôs no crisis at the border but Trump‚Äôs shutdown is creating a crisis: The safety of the nation‚Äôs air travel system is at risk, tax refunds might not go out on time, national parks are overflowing with trash and hundreds of thousands of federal employees aren‚Äôt getting paid."
1004,Sanders,Things that are national emergencies:-30 million without health insurance-15 million children in poverty-Tens of thousands dying from opioids and gun violence-Climate changeThings that are not national emergencies:-Building a border wall to satisfy Fox News
1005,Sanders,"Last year, the five largest drug companies in America made nearly $60 billion in profits. The top five pharma CEOs made over $113 million in total compensation in 2017.Meanwhile, 1 in 5 Americans can‚Äôt afford their prescriptions. That should outrage every member of Congress."
1006,Sanders,"Air traffic controllers got paychecks for a total of $0 today because of Trump's government shutdown.This is a crisis!Mr. Trump, stop holding our federal employees hostage as political pawns. Open the government now."
1007,Sanders,"In the richest country in the history of the world, Americans should not have to live in fear that they will die because they cannot afford the life-saving medication they need. Pharma's greed is killing Americans and that has got to end. (with @BizHealthPol)"
1008,Sanders,"Trump has told the American people several hundred times that Mexico would pay for the wall. That is a lie. If his wall were to be built, Mexico would not pay for it. American taxpayers would."
1009,Sanders,"Why do Americans pay the highest prices for prescription drugs in the world?Why are there no restrictions on what a drug company can charge?The answer is simple: other than Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry is the most powerful political force in the country."
1010,Sanders,"How many people need to die, how many people need to get unnecessarily sicker before Congress is prepared to take on the greed of the prescription drug industry? Today, we are introducing legislation to end the pharmaceutical industry‚Äôs greed and drastically lower drug prices."
1011,Sanders,"Instead of trying to bring us together as a people, Trump is trying to divide us up. And, in the process, divert our attention away from the real crises facing the working families of this nation."
1012,Sanders,It gives me no pleasure to tell you what you already know: Trump lies all of the time and his speech last night was no exception.
1013,Sanders,"""Make no mistake, the Trump shutdown is anti-veteran,"" - This Iraq War Marine Corps veteran @will_c_fischer wants you to know that 31 percent of all federal employees are veterans and Trump is holding many of their paychecks hostage. (With @votevets)"
1014,Sanders,"There's no crisis at the border. President Trump, you want to talk about crises? -30 million Americans have no health insurance-Climate change threatens our planet-Half of older Americans have no retirement savings-40 million are dealing with outrageous student debt"
1015,Sanders,"President Trump, We don‚Äôt need to create artificial crises. We have enough real ones. Let us end this shutdown and bring the American people together around an agenda that will improve life for all of our people. #BernieResponds"
1016,Sanders,"Tonight I will deliver a live response to President Trump's Oval Office address, immediately following Sen. Schumer and Rep. Pelosi's response. Tune in here: https://t.co/GDd8c2juru"
1017,Sanders,Democrats must block any legislation that does not reopen the government. It is absolutely absurd that the first Senate legislation during the shutdown is a bill which punishes Americans who exercise their constitutional right to engage in political activity.
1018,Sanders,"Trump's reckless shutdown is threatening the livelihoods of some 800,000 federal workers. Mr. President: Enough is enough. Federal workers must be paid and the government must reopen."
1019,Sanders,97% of Americans support comprehensive background checks. It's time for Republicans in Congress to listen to the American people and stop simply obeying the dictates of the NRA. We need to pass common sense gun safety legislation now.
1020,Sanders,"We do not need to waste billions on an unneeded wall so that Trump can appease right-wing extremists.We need to create millions of good-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure ‚Äî roads, bridges, water systems, rail and affordable housing."
1021,Sanders,"The fight for Medicare for all will be opposed by all of the special interests‚Äîdrug companies, insurance companies, Wall Street‚Äîwho make billions from our dysfunctional health care system.They may have the money. But we have the"
1022,Sanders,"There is no border crisis. The real crisis is that 800,000 people don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôll pay their mortgages, pay student loans, put gas in their cars or put food on the table because of Donald Trump‚Äôs government shutdown."
1023,Sanders,"As a result of Trump's shutdown, 800,000 federal employees are in danger of not receiving a paycheck.They're worried about how they'll pay their mortgages, feed their families and put gas in their cars.Unbelievably, Republican leader Mitch McConnell refuses to take action."
1024,Sanders,"The U.S. has the world's largest economy. Yet, we lag far behind many other developed countries in health care, life expectancy, infant mortality, poverty, education and infrastructure. We need a government that works for all, not just the 1%."
1025,Sanders,"Jimmy Carter was right when he said that America is ""an oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery.""Every day we are sliding further away from democracy into an oligarchic form of government. Democracy should be about one person, one vote‚Äînot billionaires buying elections."
1026,Sanders,Sen. Van Hollen is absolutely right. We should block consideration of all bills on the Senate floor until we end the Trump shutdown and reopen the federal government.
1027,Sanders,It‚Äôs absurd that the first bill during the shutdown is legislation which punishes Americans who exercise their constitutional right to engage in political activity. Democrats must block consideration of any bills that don‚Äôt reopen the government. Let's get our priorities right.
1028,Sanders,"Mr. President, I doubt very much that you can ‚Äúrelate‚Äù to federal workers. When is the last time you had to choose between paying your mortgage, feeding your family or putting gas in the car? End the shutdown. Pay federal employees."
1029,Sanders,"As a result of Trump's government shutdown, many federal employees will be unable to pay their mortgages or feed their kids. The Senate's first act must be to re-open the government.  Leader McConnell: Let the Senate vote on the House bills to re-open the government."
1030,Sanders,"The business model of Wall Street is fraud. When the 6 largest American banks have $10 trillion in assets, equivalent to 54% of our GDP, it's time to break them up. We need banks which invest in the real economy and create jobs, not rip us off."
1031,Sanders,"If President Trump is really concerned about national security then why isn't he paying employees at the FBI, TSA and other security agencies who work every day to protect this country? President Trump. End your shutdown of the government. Pay federal employees."
1032,Sanders,"President Trump, federal employees are not billionaires. They have to feed their kids and pay their mortgages. End the shutdown now and treat federal employees with the respect they are due."
1033,Sanders,"Congratulations to Republican Senators Cory Gardner and Susan Collins for understanding that 800,000 federal employees must be paid. If Leader McConnell allows the Senate to vote, we can end the government shut down now."
1034,Sanders,"Rep. Liz Cheney, daughter of Dick Cheney, yesterday attacked ""the fraud of socialism."" Really? I wasn't aware that it was ""socialism"" that lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and got us into a horrific war that we should never have started."
1035,Sanders,"Is it ""radical"" to demand that all Americans have health care, that billionaires pay their fair share of taxes, that workers earn at least $15 an hour and that we transform our energy system in order to combat climate change? I don't think so."
1036,Sanders,I want to congratulate the House for holding hearings for the first time on Medicare for all. I‚Äôm confident the results will show that Medicare for all is the way forward if we want to guarantee heath care to all people in a cost-effective way.
1037,Sanders,"At a time when climate change threatens our planet, when our infrastructure is crumbling, when 30 million people have no health insurance, I'm concerned that the concept of PAYGO will make it harder for Congress to address the many crises facing our working families."
1038,Sanders,Trump is a pathological liar. How can we develop rational public policy when we have a president who doesn't know the difference between truth and falsehood? Not a good situation for the most powerful nation on Earth.
1039,Sanders,"Health care is a right, not a privilege. We need Medicare for All so we can end the disgrace of 30 million Americans having no health insurance, and many more being underinsured with high deductibles and co-payments."
1040,Sanders,"Our job: pursue a bold agenda that transforms our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. We're at war with climate change and, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, we cannot lose."
1041,Sanders,We must look at climate change as if it were a devastating military attack against the United States and the entire planet. And we must respond accordingly.
1042,Sanders,"As 2018 comes to an end, Jane and I want to wish all of you a happy New Year's Eve and a healthy and wonderful new year."
1043,Sanders,"Mr. President. Two children are dead because of your immigration policies. For once, be an adult. Stop blaming everyone else. Take responsibility for your actions."
1044,Sanders,"Congratulations to Chuck Todd and Meet the Press for holding a serious discussion about climate change. Will this be a breakthrough moment for mainstream TV, which rarely discusses this issue?"
1045,Sanders,"The fossil fuel industry is now the equivalent of the tobacco industry. It creates death and destruction, and then spends billions denying its responsibility.We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy."
1046,Sanders,One of the great crises facing our democracy is power of the billionaire class over our political process. The needs of ordinary people are ignored when the very rich and their Super PACs buy elections. We need to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.
1047,Sanders,"If it is just ""bi-partisan politics"" to spend some $700 billion a year on the military, more than the next ten nations combined, why is it a ""radical"" idea to lower student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition-free?"
1048,Sanders,"The extraordinary power of the corporate establishment is not just over our economy and political life, it is over our imagination and our ability to envision a different kind of world."
1049,Sanders,"The American people are tired of a president who is a liar, a fraud, a narcissist and a bully. They want leadership which unites us, not divides us. They want policies which work for all, not just the wealthy few."
1050,Sanders,"As we enter the new year let us not forget that while the very rich become much richer, millions of Americans are unable to afford health care, housing, prescription drugs or education. In 2019 we can do better. We must do better."
1051,Sanders,"There will no real social progress in this country unless we have the courage to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the military-industrial complex, the fossil fuel industry, the prison industry and all the other forces of greed."
1052,Sanders,"The six largest banks now have over $10 trillion in assets‚Äî54% of GDP. We must break up these huge financial institutions. If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist."
1053,Sanders,"As we celebrate Christmas and the holiday season, let us rededicate ourselves to a world of peace - and economic, social, racial and environmental justice."
1054,Sanders,Jane and I want to take this opportunity to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season.
1055,Sanders,"While Trump talks about a ""booming economy,"" the reality for working families is:-Real wages for average workers are lower than in 1973-80% live paycheck to paycheck-Half of older Americans have no retirement savingsNew Year‚Äôs Resolution: Create an economy that works for all."
1056,Sanders,"Today, over 40 million Americans live in poverty - including millions of children and seniors.  As we enter the holiday season, and think about the future of our country, let us not forget the biblical admonishment: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."""
1057,Sanders,"Wealth inequality is a profound moral issue this country must address. The richest 3 Americans cannot continue owning more wealth than the bottom half of our country, while over 40% cannot afford the basics to live."
1058,Sanders,"We must end the growing concentration of ownership in agribusiness and fight to preserve and strengthen family based agriculture. The American people deserve high quality, locally grown food."
1059,Sanders,"This is what Christmas season looks like in Trumpland:-Take away paychecks of 800,000 workers by shutting the government.-Take away $1.40 meals from 755,000 hungry, unemployed Americans.- Give Pfizer a $26.5 billion tax cut after it increased the price of life saving drugs."
1060,Sanders,This president‚Äôs erratic and impulsive behavior is a danger to our country and a major impediment in terms of addressing the crises we face. His decision to shut down the government is just the latest example of this destructive pattern.
1061,Sanders,"Think about it for a minute.Democrats and Republicans come together, after a whole lot of debate, and agree on how to keep the government open.And then, after a day of right-wing media criticism, the president undermines all of that. To say the least, that is problematic."
1062,Sanders,Trump's decision to shut down the government is just the latest example of a destructive pattern. The time is long overdue for congressional Republicans to stand up to him.
1063,Sanders,"""I am proud to shut down the government... I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I‚Äôm not going to blame you for it."" ‚Äì@realDonaldTrump, last Tuesday"
1064,Sanders,"If Trump shuts the federal government down, should federal employees be available to escort him to his beachfront resort in Florida for a 16-day holiday? I don‚Äôt think so!"
1065,Sanders,"This is what happened:1) The Senate unanimously voted to keep the government open2) The House was ready to pass the bill3) Rush and Fox &amp; Friends criticized Trump4) Trump now wants to shut down the government, putting 800,000 people out of work the week before Christmas"
1066,Sanders,"Last Tuesday, Trump said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud to shut down the government.‚Äù And he did. Despite unanimous Republican support in the Senate and overwhelming Republican support in the House, Trump will leave 800,000 federal employees without paychecks. How‚Äôs that for a holiday gift?"
1067,Sanders,"Trump, the ‚Äúgreat friend‚Äù of American workers, is now prepared to ignore the unanimous U.S. Senate bill to fund the government.While Trump heads off to his exclusive golf club in Florida, his Christmas gift to some 800,000 federal employees is to deny them their paychecks."
1068,Sanders,"85,000 children have already starved to death as a result of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen.Millions more face the prospect of famine and death.The U.S. should be doing everything we can to support the ceasefire, not undermining it. Disgusting!"
1069,Sanders,"Let‚Äôs be absolutely clear about what Trump is doing with his latest food stamps work requirements rule: he is attacking the poor.We should be expanding programs like food stamps that lift people out of poverty, not making them even harder to access."
1070,Sanders,"There's no greater disservice to our veterans than to deny them the VA health care they've earned by draining the VA of its resources in order to line the pockets of corporate CEOs. If Trump thinks privatizing the VA is what's best for our veterans, he is dead wrong."
1071,Sanders,Nearly half of American adults have had an immediate family member incarcerated at some point. HALF.Imagine what we could accomplish if we invested in jobs and education instead of paying $80 billion a year to lock up 2.2 million people.
1072,Sanders,"Medicare for All is not a crazy idea.What's crazy is that our health care system is designed to make as much profit for insurance and pharma executives as possible, while ordinary people die because they can't afford the care and medicine they need."
1073,Sanders,"I'm glad the First Step Act passed. But there is much more needed to achieve comprehensive criminal justice reform. We must:-End cash bail-End private prisons-End mandatory minimums-Reinstate the federal parole systemOur primary goal must be rehabilitation, not punishment."
1074,Sanders,"Trump promised that his tax giveaway to the wealthy would put an extra $4,000 into the pockets of middle-class families.He lied. Bonuses are up $0.02/hr since the GOP tax cuts passed.Our job: Repeal Trump‚Äôs tax breaks for the wealthy and rebuild the disappearing middle class."
1075,Sanders,"What I want to know is: if Sears has $25 million to give bonuses to executives, why is the company telling laid off employees they don't have the money to pay their severance?"
1076,Sanders,U.S. student loan debt outstanding reached a record $1.465 trillion last month.You know the most revolting part of this crisis?The federal government makes billions in profits off of student loans each year.
1077,Sanders,Happy National Maple Syrup Day! Vermont is the biggest producer of maple syrup in America‚Äîproducing nearly 2 million gallons of maple syrup last year alone. That's a lot of syrup.

1080,Sanders,"""You say you love your children above all else, yet you are stealing their futures right before their very eyes,"" - This 15-year-old activist @GretaThunberg just called out world leaders for their global inaction on climate change."
1081,Sanders,"Today Gov. Scott Walker signed disgraceful, undemocratic legislation to limit the power of incoming Democratic officials in Wisconsin. Republicans like him across the country are attacking democracy and their power grabs must be stopped."
1082,Sanders,It's not just the Saudi-led war in Yemen or the brutal and cold-blooded murder of Jamal Khashoggi. It's the entire structure of the despotic Saudi regime.The time is long overdue for the U.S. to rethink its relationship with Saudi
1083,Sanders,This is an historic day. For the first time in 45 years the U.S. Senate came together to end an unauthorized war. We have woken up the Congress to its constitutional responsibility. This is the beginning of a new day.
1084,Sanders,Today we have brought Republicans and Democrats together in a very historic moment to take back the Congress' constitutional responsibility on matters of war.
1085,Sanders,"I want to thank my colleagues and the many people at the grassroots level who helped us pass this historic resolution. Today, 45 years after the passage of the War Powers Act, the U.S. Senate finally used that authority for the first time."
1086,Sanders,"The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen has resulted in the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth. That crisis is 85,000 children starving to death; 10,000 new cases of cholera every single week; and the United Nations telling us that Yemen is on the verge of imminent famine."
1087,Sanders,"What the Senate did today is say that the United States Congress is sick and tired of abdicating its constitutional responsibility on matters of war.We will not continue to have our military posture dictated by a despotic, murderous regime in Saudi Arabia."
1088,Sanders,HISTORIC VICTORY: The Senate has voted to stop U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. This is the first time ever that the Senate has voted to end an unauthorized war.
1089,Sanders,It is time for the United States Congress to tell the despotic government of Saudi Arabia that we do not intend to follow their lead in their military adventurism. Speaking live now: https://t.co/Sp719YH6Mj
1090,Sanders,"Everyone needs to see this to understand the consequences of today's Senate vote to end U.S. support for the war in Yemen.85,000 kids have starved to death.14 million Yemenis are on the brink of starvation. The Senate must end our involvement in this humanitarian disaster."
1091,Sanders,This Fox News judge does a great job explaining why President Trump is in real trouble.
1092,Sanders,The people of Denmark are some of the happiest on earth. I met with @DanJoergensen of Denmark's Social Democratic Party (@Spolitik) to learn why.
1093,Sanders,"For the first time, the Senate will vote today on ending an unauthorized war. 14 million people in Yemen are on the brink of starvation. 85,000 kids have starved to death.The U.S. must stop supporting this disastrous Saudi-led war. https://t.co/3oHVOYRBYJ"
1094,Sanders,"""I don't look at a recession as a bad thing."" - Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase (one of the big banks that crashed the economy 10 years ago)."
1095,Sanders,"Let us show the world today that the U.S. Senate recognizes that real American power does not come from our ability to blow things up, but from our ability to bring people together.We must finally end US support for the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen."
1096,Sanders,"The eyes of the world are watching the Senate today. Shortly, we will vote to end U.S. support for the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. Watch my speech here: https://t.co/qmkBVnHyEz"
1097,Sanders,Today the U.S. Senate will vote on whether to end US support for the devastating Saudi-led war in Yemen. This would be the first time ever that the Senate has voted to end an unauthorized war. We must finally end US involvement in this humanitarian and strategic disaster.
1098,Sanders,Tomorrow I'll move to proceed to the resolution I've offered with @SenMikeLee and @ChrisMurphyCT to end US involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. I am optimistic that a bipartisan coalition will vote to make clear we will no longer support Saudi Arabia in its destructive war.
1099,Sanders,Spread the word: Saturday is the last day of open enrollment to sign up for health insurance. Go to https://t.co/GjiTq2lZbz to choose a plan and get covered.
1100,Sanders,1 out of 5 Americans cannot afford the medication they need.Pharmaceutical executives must be held accountable for the massive price-fixing scheme they have concocted to jack up the price of life-saving prescription drugs.
1101,Sanders,"The bad news: our president doesn't believe in science.The good news: today 1,000 young people stood up to demand that Congress take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system to sustainable energy.We're going to win this fight for our people and planet."
1102,Sanders,Thankfully there is a way to make sure that nobody has to delay or cancel the care they need because they can't afford it. #MedicareForAll
1103,Sanders,People 65 and older must have pretty good health insurance ü§î
1104,Sanders,"Sears wants to give its executives $25 million in bonuses after closing over 100 stores and laying off thousands of employees. My friends, this is what a rigged economy is all about. (with @riseupretail)"
1105,Sanders,"This report from Yemen states it clearly‚ÄîU.S. tax dollars are being used to starve children in Yemen. Next week the Senate will vote on SJ Res 54, and tell the president and the world that the U.S. must no longer be complicit in this humanitarian disaster."
1106,Sanders,"There is virtually unanimous agreement in Congress that the murder of Jamal Khashoggi must be addressed. I look forward to supporting my colleagues‚Äô additional legislative proposals at the appropriate time, but right now I am focused on securing an up or down vote on S.J.Res. 54."
1107,Sanders,"I look forward to an up-or-down vote next week to end U.S involvement in the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. I am confident that we have the bipartisan votes to pass the War Powers resolution in the Senate, which would be an historic step forward."
1108,Sanders,This Republican mayor leads the first city in Texas powered by 100% renewable energy. Addressing climate change and creating millions of good-paying jobs in the process should not be a partisan issue.
1109,Sanders,What's it like fleeing a wildfire? Listen to this nurse describe how she and her team narrowly escaped California's recent climate change-fueled disasters.
1110,Sanders,Walmart is the poster child of corporate greed in America today. We must demand that they pay a living wage.
1111,Sanders,It is really a disgrace that the major TV networks constantly ignore climate change or give climate deniers a platform. That is exactly why I brought together some of the greatest climate experts in the world to do what the mainstream media won't do.
1112,Sanders,"12 million people in Yemen are suffering from severe hunger and 85,000 kids have already died from starvation as a result of the Saudi-led war.The United States should not be supporting Saudi Arabia in this disastrous war. The U.S. Senate must vote to end our involvement."
1113,Sanders,Antroinette's daughter Antavia died because she had to ration her insulin‚Äîsomething that should never happen again in the wealthiest country in the world. Pharma's greed is literally killing people in this country and they must be stopped.
1114,Sanders,"This Californian saw the effect of the disastrous wildfires firsthand. If we don't get our act together to boldly address climate change, this is going to be the new normal."
1115,Sanders,"Thank you to the many, many people who attended and watched our groundbreaking Solving Our Climate Crisis town hall last night, as well as our terrific panelists. This was just the beginning of a movement to protect the planet and create millions of jobs. #ClimateTownHall"
1116,Sanders,"Some argue that the US is not really engaged in hostilities in Yemen. But as these Yemeni human rights activists told me recently, when Yemenis see ""Made in USA"" on the bombs killing their children, it‚Äôs very clear that the US is part of this war. This must end."
1117,Sanders,"Our job is to be bold. Our job is to think very big and to go forward in a moral struggle that says: we will protect our planet, not just for our own children but for all the children of the world. #ClimateTownHall"
1118,Sanders,"Think for a moment‚Äîthat instead of spending well over a trillion dollars on weapons of destruction, we could be spending that money on transforming our energy system and protecting the planet. #ClimateTownHall"

1128,Sanders,"It is disgraceful that Republicans in Wisconsin and Michigan, having lost on Nov. 6, are trying to decrease the power of incoming Democratic governors Tony Evers and Gretchen Whitmer and limit future voting. This power-grab is pathetic and must be stopped."
1129,Sanders,"Climate change is the most pressing issue facing the world.Tonight I'm hosting a national town hall on climate change with @billmckibben, @Ocasio2018, @VanJones68, @shailenewoodley and more. Tune in at 7 PM ET: https://t.co/AJPHmfyswT"
1130,Sanders,Americans living with HIV/AIDS should not have to suffer because they can‚Äôt afford the outrageous prices charged for medicine they need to live.Our job is to bring down the cost of prescription drugs and make health care a right for all. #WorldAIDSDay
1131,Sanders,President George H.W. Bush served our country honorably. He and Barbara will be remembered for their humble and devoted service to the country they loved. Jane and I send our deepest condolences to the entire Bush family.
1132,Sanders,"ABC, CBS, and NBC mentioned climate change in less than 4% of their coverage of the California wildfires.On Monday night, I'm hosting a town hall on climate change so that we can have a serious discussion on this issue. I hope you'll join us: https://t.co/AJPHmfyswT"
1133,Sanders,"Monday night at 7 PM ET, we are going to do what the mainstream media fails so often to do. We are going to talk about the most important issue facing us ‚Äì climate change.Join us live on Twitter, Facebook and Youtube for a town hall on climate change: https://t.co/AJPHmfyswT"
1134,Sanders,"A renegotiated NAFTA must stop the outsourcing of U.S. jobs, end the race to the bottom, protect the environment and lower the outrageously high price of prescription drugs. Trump‚Äôs NAFTA 2.0 does not meet these standards and I will strongly oppose it in its current form."
1135,Sanders,"Climate change is not an issue we can afford to ignore any longer.On Monday night I'm hosting a national town hall with @billmckibben, @Ocasio2018, @VanJones68, @shailenewoodley and more on how to tackle this crisis. Tune in: https://t.co/AJPHmfyswT"

1137,Sanders,The Trump tax scam was a fraud from the start and Republicans are now paying the price.
1138,Sanders,"For the first time, the U.S. Senate just voted to advance a resolution withdrawing U.S. Armed Forces from an unauthorized and unconstitutional war. Let us bring this catastrophic war in Yemen to an end, and help bring peace and humanitarian aid to this tortured country."
1139,Sanders,The Senate is voting on whether to move forward with my resolution to end U.S. support for the horrific Saudi-led war in Yemen. Watch here: https://t.co/Ax7y6TXwny
1140,Sanders,"Amal Hussain died recently in Yemen. She was 7 years old. She is one of 85,000 children who have starved to death as a result of the catastrophic Saudi-led war in Yemen. The Senate has an opportunity today to end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's destructive foreign policy."
1141,Sanders,"Do not forget: it was a U.S. bomb that killed 40 children on a school bus in Yemen in August‚Äîsome of the many thousands of civilians who have died in this horrific, Saudi-led war.The Senate must vote today to end our support for these atrocities."
1142,Sanders,"This American woman experienced what it's like to have universal health care in the UK, and now she doesn't want to move back to the United States. (with @t1international)"
1143,Sanders,"Thousands of civilians have been killed in Yemen, some by U.S. bombs.85,000 children have starved to death.The Senate can end U.S. support for this unconstitutional, catastrophic, Saudi-led war today."
1144,Sanders,Listen to this Fox News pundit condemn the tear gassing of women and children.
1145,Sanders,The United States should not be supporting a catastrophic war led by a despotic regime with a dangerous and irresponsible military policy. The Senate must vote to end U.S. support for the unconstitutional Saudi-led war in Yemen.
1146,Sanders,"At a time when voting rights are under grave attack, there is absolutely no place on the federal bench for Thomas Farr, who both authored and defended tactics designed to suppress minority voters. I strongly oppose his nomination."
1147,Sanders,The United States should not be partnering in Saudi Arabia's disastrous military adventurism. The Senate can stand up this week and take an important step toward ending the brutal and unauthorized war in
1148,Sanders,"The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, with U.S. support, has killed thousands of civilians. Over 85,000 children have died of starvation.Enough is enough. The Senate must vote to end U.S. support for this war."
1149,Sanders,"We should be the ones pushing hardest for a ceasefire in Yemen, not standing in the way of one. The Senate must vote to end US military support for this catastrophe, so we can focus on humanitarian aid and a diplomatic solution."
1150,Sanders,"This week I will go to the floor of the Senate to try to stop a war that has led to the deaths of many thousands of civilians, mass starvation and one of the greatest humanitarian crises in the world.The US Senate must vote to end our role in Saudi Arabia‚Äôs war in Yemen."
1151,Sanders,"The fact that we have a President of the United States who doesn't believe in science is an international embarrassment and incredibly dangerous.Climate change is already causing devastating consequences. We need bold action, not denials."
1152,Sanders,"Walmart workers are sick and tired of working for starvation wages. I say to the Walton family of Walmart, do what's right and pay your workers a living wage. (with @UFCW)"
1153,Sanders,We will hold a live streamed town hall Monday Dec. 3 at 7 PM to discuss the crisis of climate change and how we solve it. More info here: https://t.co/b9RqndtThf
1154,Sanders,"Pharmaceutical corporate greed is literally killing people who cannot afford their medication. Together, we can change that. @SSWorks"
1155,Sanders,On Monday Dec. 3 we‚Äôre holding a national town hall on addressing the crisis of climate change and creating tens of millions of jobs in the process. I hope you‚Äôll join us. https://t.co/AJPHmfyswT
1156,Sanders,The Trump administration tried to bury a new report about the devastating consequences of climate change. Why? Because Trump's actions are actively making it worse.Our task is clear. We must immediately and dramatically reduce carbon pollution emissions.
1157,Sanders,"Walmart insists it can't afford to pay workers $15/hr. Really? The Walton family, which owns Walmart, is the richest family in America‚Äîworth around $167 billion.Walmart: do the right thing. Raise your minimum wage to a living wage of $15/hr."
1158,Sanders,"On behalf of Jane, our four kids, seven grandkids and myself, I would like to wish everyone a very safe and happy Thanksgiving."
1159,Sanders,"With a sense of urgency, Democrats must have the courage to take on powerful special interests and fight for a progressive agenda that addresses the needs of working families."
1160,Sanders,"85,000 children have starved to death during the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen.The U.S. should not be part of Saudi Arabia's destructive foreign policy. Congress must end our participation in that war now, and help provide immediate humanitarian aid there to save lives."
1161,Sanders,President Trump is dead wrong if he believes the solution to the Postal Service's problems is to privatize it. I stand with the Postal Workers fighting to save and strengthen the Postal Service.
1162,Sanders,Alec Smith died at 26 because he was rationing insulin that was too expensive. The greed of the pharmaceutical industry is killing Americans and it has got to stop. (with @NSmithholt12)
1163,Sanders,"""Donald Trump only views veterans and military families as political props to advance his own agenda."" - @Will_C_Fischer, Iraq War Veteran, @VoteVets"
1164,Sanders,"We must do everything we can to protect our trans brothers and sisters from violence, and we will work every day until hatred and discrimination truly have no place in our society. #TDOR"
1165,Sanders,Trump is clearly very afraid of the prospect of the Senate delivering a serious rebuke to his policy by voting to end U.S. support for the Yemen war. But that is exactly what we will do when we vote on SJ Res 54 next week.
1166,Sanders,"Trump also blamed Iran for the disastrous war in Yemen, despite the fact that the Saudi-led coalition has caused the most destruction by far."
1167,Sanders,"Today President Trump, in a rambling and dishonest statement, tried to defend the despotic Saudi regime and cast doubt on the CIA‚Äôs conclusion that the crown prince was personally involved in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi."
1168,Sanders,Nobody said it would be easy to take on the drug and insurance companies and special interests who make billions from our dysfunctional health care system. But we will win this struggle for Medicare for All because the American people understand that health care is a right.
1169,Sanders,"Congratulations to the Toys R Us workers who organized and stood up to Wall Street to fight for the severance pay they deserved. We will continue to fight the greed of Wall Street and private equity, and to expand the collective bargaining rights of all Americans."
1170,Sanders,No other country allows pharma companies to charge any price they want for any reason they want. That has to change.At the start of the new Congress @RepRoKhanna and I will introduce legislation to stop Big Pharma from ripping off the American people.
1171,Sanders,"At a time of massive corporate profits, and an already regressive tax system, Amazon and other large corporations do not need corporate welfare. Instead, they need to pay their fair share of taxes."
1172,Sanders,We're holding a major town hall on Dec. 3 to talk about one of the most pressing global crises facing us today: climate change. Will you be tuning in?
1173,Sanders,"On Monday, Dec. 3 at 7 p.m. we're holding a national town hall on climate change, an issue that does not get nearly enough attention in the mainstream media. Let's go forward to protect the planet and create millions of good-paying jobs.https://t.co/AJPHmfyswT"
1174,Sanders,"The CIA has confirmed what was obvious, that Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the direction of the Saudi crown prince. The United States must thoroughly reevaluate our relationship with the brutal Saudi dictatorship, and start by ending support for the catastrophic war in Yemen."
1175,Sanders,Have your prescriptions shot up in price? Are you splitting pills in half to make your prescriptions last longer? Have you had to stop taking medicine altogether in order to pay other bills? Tell Bernie your story.
1176,Sanders,I say to the Walton family of Walmart: The American people are sick and tired of subsidizing your greed. Get off of welfare and pay your workers a living wage.
1177,Sanders,The brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents demands that we make clear that United States support for Saudi Arabia is not unconditional. It‚Äôs time to stop the war in Yemen.
1178,Sanders,"Today I met with courageous activists @ralmutawakel and @ralfaqih from Yemeni human rights group @mwatanaen. They talked about the crisis in Yemen, and how important it is to end U.S. support for this disastrous war."
1179,Sanders,"It is grossly unfair for millions of workers in this country to be earning starvation wages, while the companies they work for make billions in profits and pay their CEOs outrageously high compensation packages."
1180,Sanders,The bill I'm introducing today would prohibit large corporations from buying back stock unless they:-Pay all employees at least $15/hr-Allow employees to earn up to 7 days of paid sick leave-Ensure CEO compensation is not more than 150x median employee pay#StopWALMART
1181,Sanders,"The Walton family of Walmart is the wealthiest family in America, worth $180 billion. Middle class taxpayers should not have to subsidize Walmart‚Äôs horrendously low wages to the tune of at least $6.2 billion every year."
1182,Sanders,"While Walmart claims it cannot afford to pay its workers $15 an hour, it was able to find enough money to pay its CEO more than $22 million last year.Tomorrow @RepRoKhanna and I will be introducing The Stop WALMART Act to put an end to their outrageous greed."
1183,Sanders,Here is the simple truth:We have a president who is a racist.A president who is a sexist.A president who is a homophobe.A president who is a xenophobe.And a president who is a religious bigot.We have got to confront that truth and reject Trump's bigotry.
1184,Sanders,"The Walton family of Walmart owns more wealth than the bottom 40% of Americans.Meanwhile 55% of Walmart‚Äôs associates are food insecure.This is what we mean when we talk about a rigged economy, and why I'm introducing a bill tomorrow to make Walmart start paying a living wage."
1185,Sanders,Do you want to know why you're being ripped off every day by drug companies? Maybe it's because there are two Big Pharma lobbyists for every member of Congress.
1186,Sanders,"Trump describes the free media as an ""enemy of the people""; attacks leaders of democratic countries while cozying up to authoritarian nations; and now uses his influence to try to stop the counting of votes in FL and GA.There is only one way to describe him: Authoritarian."
1187,Sanders,"Last year, 4 members of the Walton family of Walmart made $12.7 billion in 1 day.It would take a full-time Walmart worker making $11/hr over 653,000 years to make that much.Thursday, @RepRoKhanna and I are introducing legislation to make Walmart pay its workers a living wage."
1188,Sanders,"Apply for spring internships in Senator Sanders' Vermont and Washington DC offices. The deadline to apply is Sunday, Nov. 18. See here for more information:"
1189,Sanders,"While we set aside this day to recognize their service, we must commit ourselves to keep America‚Äôs promise to our veterans, just as they kept their promise to us."
1190,Sanders,"Today, in addition to commemorating Veterans Day, we also recognize the centennial of Armistice Day and the end of World War I, a war in which many Vermonters bravely served and lost their lives."
1191,Sanders,"On days like this we are reminded of the sacrifices made by all those women and men who have worn the uniform in defense of our nation. We owe our veterans a tremendous debt of gratitude, which we will never truly be able to repay."
1192,Sanders,In the first week of the new Congress I will be re-introducing my legislation to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour. We have got to end starvation wages in the richest country in the world.
1193,Sanders,"This is a positive step. US participation is unauthorized, unconstitutional and must end completely. I will soon bring SJ Res 54 back to the floor, so the Senate can end US participation in the Yemen war as a matter of law, not simply as a matter of the president‚Äôs discretion."
1194,Sanders,"Further, at a time when too many Americans are harboring homicidal and/or suicidal thoughts, we must greatly improve access to mental health counseling."
1195,Sanders,"Congress and President Trump must finally have the courage to stand up to the NRA, and do what the American people want ‚Äì pass common sense gun safety legislation."
1196,Sanders,"There is no magical or simple solution to the epidemic of gun violence in our country. The mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California, tells us, however, that we must do everything possible to stop these never-ending tragedies."
1197,Sanders,Apply for spring internships in Senator Sanders' Vermont and Washington DC offices. The deadline to apply is Nov. 18. See here for more information: https://t.co/EPSZUJsFvB
1198,Sanders,"Congress must pass legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller‚Äôs investigation, demand that Acting AG Whitaker recuse himself from overseeing the probe based on his previous statements and only confirm a new attorney general who vows to protect Mueller's investigation."
1199,Sanders,President Trump must allow Special Counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs investigation to continue unimpeded. Any attempt by the president or the Justice Department to interfere with Mueller‚Äôs probe would be an obstruction of justice and impeachable offense.
1200,Sanders,"The Republican agenda is clear.Our plan: make health care a right to all. Stop giving tax breaks to billionaires. Protect and expand Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Transition to sustainable energy and leave behind a livable planet for our children."
1201,Sanders,"Donald Trump and his advisor think the federal minimum wage is ""a terrible idea."" Wrong. We need to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour."
1202,Sanders,It‚Äôs good to see the Trump administration finally admit what some of us have been saying for a long time: the disastrous war in Yemen must end. Next month the Senate will have the chance to show we are serious about ending US support for this war by voting on SJ Res 54.
1203,Sanders,"Brazil‚Äôs new President Jair Bolsonaro is a far-right authoritarian who has praised the former military dictatorship and referred to black activists as ‚Äúanimals.‚ÄùIt's very troubling that Bolton sees Bolsonaro as ‚Äúlike-minded‚Äù with Trump. Even more troubling, he‚Äôs probably right."
1204,Sanders,A reminder from Fox News about the migrant caravan
1205,Sanders,"Donald Trump Lies, Episode 5,541: Prescription Drugs"
1206,Sanders,Today we observe #LatinaEqualPay Day because Latina women still make only 53 cents on the dollar compared to white men. It should not be a radical idea to address that issue of basic equality.
1207,Sanders,Donald Trump's top economic adviser wants to abolish the federal minimum wage. We want to give a raise to 41 million Americans by increasing the federal minimum wage to a living wage ‚Äì $15 an hour.
1208,Sanders,"The Republican agenda is clear:1) Take health care away from 32 million Americans2) Give huge tax cuts to billionaires and large, profitable corporations3) Slash Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security4) Allow the planet to be destroyed"
1209,Sanders,"Donald Trump and his advisers believe in huge tax breaks for billionaires, but when it comes to raising wages for workers they actually want to abolish the minimum wage. Too many Americans are forced to work 2 or 3 jobs to survive. We must raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour."
1210,Sanders,"If not for Republicans' ""fiscally responsible"" policies, we would have run a $156 billion surplus this year."
1211,Sanders,"American Airlines made $1.9 billion in profits last year, but many of its workers are forced to rely on food stamps to survive. It's time for American Airlines to offer its Envoy Air workers a new contract that pays them a living wage."
1212,Sanders,"Three people own more wealth than the bottom 50% of Americans. This is what a rigged economy is all about and why we are fighting for a government and economy that works for ALL people, not just Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett."
1213,Sanders,"A worker making the federal minimum wage needs to work 99 hours a week, 52 weeks a year just to afford a modest one-bedroom apartment That is a national disgrace."
1214,Sanders,"American Airlines made $1.9 billion in profits last year, but many of its workers are forced to rely on food stamps to survive. Its time for American Airlines to offer its Envoy Air workers a new contract that pays them a living wage."
1215,Sanders,"The wealth of the Walton family, the owners of Walmart, increased more than 9,000% since 1982.Walmart still doesn‚Äôt pay their workers a living wage.This is what a rigged economy is all about."
1216,Sanders,"""There is no invasion. No one is coming to get you."" ‚ÄìFox News Anchor Shep Smith"
1217,Sanders,"‚ÄúThe president cannot erase the Constitution with an executive order... This is a transparent and blatantly unconstitutional attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred in the days ahead of the midterms.‚Äù ‚Äî@OmarJadwat, ACLU‚Äôs Immigrants‚Äô Rights Project"
1218,Sanders,"If this country stands for anything it has got to stand for the right of people to practice their religion, to live their lives without bigotry, without fear and certainly within their houses of worship."
1219,Sanders,The brutal murder of Mr. Khashoggi demands that we make clear that United States support for Saudi Arabia is not unconditional.
1220,Sanders,"The murder of Jamal Khashoggi is part of an alarming trend with Saudi Arabia. The United States must stand for human rights everywhere, and make clear to the Saudis that this includes their country"
1221,Sanders,"In this country we battle with words and ideas, not fists and bombs.   Acts of violence, appeals to violence and condoning violence have no place in American society."
1222,Sanders,"The news about bombing attempts against President Obama, Secretary Clinton, George Soros, CNN, various Democratic officials and others is gravely disturbing. While many more details will come to light, these deeply un-American acts of violence have no place in our democracy."
1223,Sanders,Congratulations to United Catering Operations workers for winning your union election with @unitehere! Now it‚Äôs time to bargain your first contract. Keep fighting and winning! #EqualityatUnited
1224,Sanders,Congratulations to Donald Trump for unintentionally making the case for Medicare for All.
1225,Sanders,Ending support for the Saudi war in Yemen is exactly what my colleagues and I tried to do earlier this year with SJ Res 54. Next month we will bring it back to the floor for another vote.
1226,Sanders,Too many Americans have fought and died to defend democracy. We cannot have a president who applauds a murdering despot as a ‚Äòstrong person‚Äô who ‚Äòtruly loves his country.‚Äô
1227,Sanders,"The Sears bankruptcy is yet another example that our economy is rigged for a powerful few at the top. Vulture capitalists have hollowed out a company to line their own pockets. It's time to build an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1%."
1228,Sanders,"By attacking the media and condoning violent behavior toward journalists, Trump is giving a green light to authoritarians all over the world to endanger the lives of those who work for a free press."
1229,Sanders,"We cannot have an ally who murders a dissident in cold blood, in their own consulate. That is unacceptable by any government, but especially by one so closely aligned with the United States."
1230,Sanders,The debate over climate change in Washington really has nothing to do with science. It has everything to do with campaign contributions.
1231,Sanders,"The crisis we face as a country is not because of voter fraud. It is because of voter suppression. If Republicans must intimidate and disenfranchise voters in order to win, then they should not be running for office in the first"
1232,Sanders,The president makes it more and more clear with every authoritarian he meets that he not only admires them but wants to follow their lead.
1233,Sanders,I have long been troubled by the nature of the relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. It's time for us to thoroughly reevaluate that relationship.
1234,Sanders,
1235,Sanders,"Did you know we once had a Republican president who expanded Social Security? Maybe today's Republicans should listen to what he had to say about the program, instead of trying to destroy it."
1236,Sanders,"While other states are making it harder to vote, I‚Äôm proud that Vermont is leading the nation by making it easier to participate in the political process. If we believe in a vibrant democracy, we need to have the highest voter turnout in the world."
1237,Sanders,"Trump's top economic advisor just dismissed a devastating climate change report from the United Nations. What Trump, his administration and his fossil fuel executive friends are doing to the planet is criminal."
1238,Sanders,"Another pipeline exploded, this time in British Columbia. And yet another community is now in danger. We must imediately transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy."
1239,Sanders,"Mitch McConnell wants to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to pay for Republicans' massive giveaway to the rich and large corporations. Enough!The American people must stand up and make clear to McConnell that we will expand, not cut, programs working people rely on."
1240,Sanders,"Of the many issues with Trump, his movement to an authoritarian type society here in American and his support for authoritarians around the world should be of concern to every American who believes in democracy."
1241,Sanders,"Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs crazy: throwing 32 million Americans off health insurance and cutting Medicare by $500 billion.That‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs plan.We have a better idea: Improve Medicare for seniors by providing dental, vision and hearing aids ‚Äì and expand it to guarantee health care for all."
1242,Sanders,"If your plan to get elected is to suppress as many minority voters, young voters, and voters with disabilities as possible, it's pretty clear you shouldn't be in politics in the first place."
1243,Sanders,4 Republican policies led to a $779 billion deficit in 2018:- Bush Tax Cuts: $488 B- Trump Tax Cuts: $164 B- Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan: $127 B- Defense increases since 9/11: $156 BWithout tax cuts for the wealthy and endless wars we would've had a $156 billion SURPLUS.
1244,Sanders,"Trump doesn't believe that universal health care works anywhere in the world. He should listen to what he said about Canada, Scotland and Australia. Every other major country on earth does it. Stop lying Mr. President."
1245,Sanders,"Next month, I plan to give the Senate another chance to vote on my resolution to end our support for the war in Yemen, to reassert Congressional authority over matters of war, and to show the Saudis that they do not have a blank check to continue human rights violations."
1246,Sanders,The Saudi-led war in Yemen has become the world's largest humanitarian disaster. The recent disappearance and likely assassination of Jamal Khashoggi only underscores how urgent it has become for the United States to redefine our relationship with Saudi Arabia.
1247,Sanders,"In Georgia, in order to try to win the election, cowardly Republicans are blatantly suppressing the vote and denying many African Americans the right to vote. Every American, no matter their political view, must vigorously protest this outrageous action."
1248,Sanders,Find out what happened to Jamal Khashoggi and holding the perpetrators accountable is more important than defense contractor profits. The time is long overdue for us to reevaluate the US-Saudi relationship and ask whether it's actually advancing our interests and values.
1249,Sanders,Election Day must become a national holiday. In America we should be celebrating our democracy and doing everything possible to make it easier for people to participate in the political process.
1250,Sanders,"Anyone who tries to suppress the vote is simply a coward. If you can't win an election based on your ideas, then get the hell out of politics."
1251,Sanders,Trump lied 19 times about Medicare for all in half an op-ed. How is that even possible?
1252,Sanders,"Dwight D. Eisenhower was not a radical socialist, he was a Republican. And he tried to warn us about the ""military industrial complex."""
1253,Sanders,"Given the president‚Äôs propensity to lie about almost everything, it is not surprising that Trump is grossly distorting what my Medicare for All legislation does.My response to his disastrous op-ed yesterday:"
1254,Sanders,This is very good news. We can't properly reform our broken criminal justice system without ending the death penalty. We must abolish the death penalty once and for all.
1255,Sanders,"Our job is to break up the largest financial institutions in the country, not reward their greed, recklessness and illegal behavior which nearly destroyed our economy."
1256,Sanders,"If the Saudi regime murdered Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist critic, in their own consulate, there must be accountability and an unequivocal condemnation by the United States."
1257,Sanders,Republicans in Congress want the American people to believe that their tax scam was passed to benefit the middle class. But we know the truth: it was just a payoff to their donors.
1258,Sanders,As a nation we must fix our broken health care system and give mental and behavioral health care the attention and resources they deserve. #WorldMentalHealthDay
1259,Sanders,"Not only are the Koch brothers and other Republican billionaires trying to buy elections, Republican officials are actively working to suppress the vote. How cowardly is that! We need universal voter registration in this"
1260,Sanders,"Not only is Trump lying about Medicare for All. This president, who fought to throw 32 million Americans off of health insurance, is acting like he cares about health care for seniors or anyone else."
1261,Sanders,Brett Kavanaugh celebrated his confirmation over the weekend at a party at the home of Facebook‚Äôs top lobbyist.
1262,Sanders,Does single-payer health care mean ‚Äúgovernment-run‚Äù health care? This Canadian doctor breaks down the myth. #MedicareForAll
1263,Sanders,"Donald Trump, who has a very difficult time telling the truth about anything, is lying about Medicare for All. Our proposal wouldn't cut benefits for seniors. In fact, we expand benefits, eliminate deductibles and copays and lower the cost of prescription drugs."
1264,Sanders,"Donald Trump led the effort to throw 32 million Americans off of health care and proposed massive cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security, so it should come as no surprise that he is opposed to our effort to guarantee health care for all Americans."
1265,Sanders,"At a time when 44 million Americans have $1.5 trillion in student debt, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has invested millions in companies that take advantage of kids trying to get a higher education."
1266,Sanders,Donald Trump's choice for Social Security Commissioner wants to CUT Social Security.
1267,Sanders,"Hurricane Florence caused 350,000 gallons of toxic coal ash to spill into Carolina waterways. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is attempting to weaken EPA rules that protect our waterways."
1268,Sanders,Listen to this former Wall Street banker explain how the big banks can crash our economy again if we don't break them up.
1269,Sanders,Millions of Americans like Mario who want to organize unions are unable to do so because of the coercive and often illegal behavior of their employers. That has got to stop.
1270,Sanders,Authoritarians seek power by promoting division and hatred. We will promote unity and inclusion. #SandersSAIS
1271,Sanders,Our job is to make sure that we commit more resources to taking care of people than we do on weapons designed to kill them. #SandersSAIS
1272,Sanders,"The world spends a total of $1.7 trillion a year on the military.The cost to end poverty is $175 billion per year for 20 years, about 10% of what the world spends on weapons.Donald Trump thinks we should spend more on these weapons. I want to spend less. #SandersSAIS"
1273,Sanders,"Our job is to rally the entire planet to stand up to the fossil fuel industry, which continues to make huge profits while their carbon emissions destroy the planet for our children and grandchildren. #SandersSAIS"
1274,Sanders,"The idea that political donors in America expect a specific policy result in exchange for their contributions‚Äîa quid pro quo, the definition of corruption‚Äîis no longer even seen as scandalous. This sort of corruption is common among authoritarian regimes. #SandersSAIS"
1275,Sanders,"We need to understand that the struggle for democracy is bound up with the struggle against kleptocracy and corruption, both here in the United States as well as abroad. #SandersSAIS"
1276,Sanders,"Even as Trump draws closer to authoritarian leaders like Putin, Orban in Hungary, Erdogan in Turkey, Duterte in the Philippines, and North Korea‚Äôs Kim Jong Un, Trump is needlessly increasing tensions with our democratic European allies. #SandersSAIS"
1277,Sanders,"It‚Äôs hard to imagine that Israel‚Äôs Netanyahu government would have passed the recent ‚ÄúNation State law,‚Äù which essentially codifies the second-class status of Israel‚Äôs non-Jewish citizens, if Netanyahu wasn‚Äôt confident that Trump would support him. #SandersSAIS"
1278,Sanders,"Three years ago, who would have imagined that the United States would refuse to take sides between Canada‚Äîour democratic neighbor and second largest trading partner‚Äîand Saudi Arabia on an issue of human rights. #SandersSAIS"
1279,Sanders,"If it is true that the Saudi regime murdered Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist critic, in their own consulate, there must be accountability, and an unequivocal condemnation by the United States. #SandersSAIS"
1280,Sanders,There‚Äôs no question that authoritarian leaders around the world have drawn inspiration from the fact that the president of the world‚Äôs oldest and most powerful democracy shatters democratic norms and attacks the independent media and judiciary. #SandersSAIS
1281,Sanders,"We need to counter oligarchic authoritarianism with a strong global progressive movement that speaks to the needs of working people, that recognizes that many of the problems we are faced with are the product of a failed status quo. #SandersSAIS"
1282,Sanders,"Leaders in the new authoritarian axis share key qualities: intolerance toward minorities, hostility toward democratic norms, antagonism toward a free media, and a belief that leaders of government should be able use their power to serve their own financial interests. #SandersSAIS"
1283,Sanders,What we are seeing now in the world is the rise of a new authoritarian axis. #SandersSAIS
1284,Sanders,"On one hand, we see a worldwide movement toward authoritarianism, oligarchy, and kleptocracy. On the other hand, we see a movement toward strengthening democracy, egalitarianism, and justice. #SandersSAIS"
1285,Sanders,"We spend $700 billion a year on the military and have been at war in Afghanistan for 17 years and Iraq for 15. The time is long overdue for a vigorous discussion about our foreign policy, and how it needs to change in this new era. #SandersSAIS"
1286,Sanders,"LIVE: Watch Sen. Sanders speak at @SAISHopkins on about the problem of authoritarian nationalism threatening democratic societies, and the need to build a global progressive movement. https://t.co/DtAAA89qFy"
1287,Sanders,"The rise of authoritarianism is a challenge for all of us who support democratic values. Today at 11 AM I will deliver a speech at Johns Hopkins SAIS on the importance of ""Building a Global Democratic Movement to Counter Authoritarianism."" #SandersSAIS"
1288,Sanders,"The good news is that we have the technology to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels. The bad news is that Congress and the White House lack the political will to stand up to the fossil fuel industry. Together, you and I will change that."
1289,Sanders,"The rise of authoritarian nationalism is a challenge for all of us who support democratic values. Tomorrow at 11 AM I will deliver a speech at Johns Hopkins SAIS on the importance of ""Building a Global Democratic Movement to Counter"
1290,Sanders,"I am disappointed but not surprised by this vote. Unless I‚Äôm very mistaken, Kavanaugh will become part of a hard-right majority. I‚Äôm also deeply concerned that credible allegations of sexual assault were not fully investigated and the precedent that sets for the future."
1291,Sanders,The disgrace of what has taken place with Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination will not be lost on the American people. We are mobilized from coast to coast.
1292,Sanders,Judge Kavanaugh is not worthy of joining the Supreme Court.- He will become a part of the hard-right majority on the Supreme Court- There are very credible allegations of sexual assault against him- He lied to Congress
1293,Sanders,"""To be a good judge and a good umpire, it's important to have the proper demeanor ... to keep our emotions in check."" ‚ÄìBrett Kavanaugh, 2015"
1294,Sanders,"Judge Kavanaugh believes net neutrality violates the First Amendment rights of corporations. Yes, corporations..."
1295,Sanders,"The President should lead this country in changing the culture, making it easier for women to come forward and tell their stories, making it clear to boys and men that in this country, that type of behavior is unacceptable. Instead, he mocked a truly courageous woman."
1296,Sanders,I stand with Adriana and every McDonald‚Äôs worker fighting for a living wage and a union. McDonald‚Äôs greed must end.
1297,Sanders,"If Amazon and Disney can pay $15 an hour, so can McDonald's, which made $5.1 billion in profits last year. My message to McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook: No one in America, especially those working for a profitable corporation like McDonald‚Äôs, should be living in poverty."
1298,Sanders,"McDonald's made $5.1 billion in profits last year and rewarded wealthy shareholders with over $7.7 billion.Meanwhile, many McDonald's workers need food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive.That is unacceptable. McDonald's workers need $15 and a union."
1299,Sanders,Let me say this to all the survivors out there: I hear you. I believe you. Thank you for speaking out.
1300,Sanders,"Trump‚Äôs remarks last night were unusually horrendous. Dr. Ford has received death threats. Nazis have protested outside her house. Last week, she was forced to publicly answer questions about an experience so painful it still haunts her.And Trump's response was to mock her."
1301,Sanders,No financial institution should be so large that its failure would cause catastrophic risk to millions of Americans or to our nation‚Äôs economic
1302,Sanders,"The 4 largest banks in this country (JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo) are on average 80% larger today than they were before we bailed them out.If these banks were too big to fail 10 years ago, what would happen if any of them were to fail today?"
1303,Sanders,"If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. Join me live as we introduce our bill to break up the largest banks in America: https://t.co/yOrqVMtUtk"
1304,Sanders,What happened at Amazon is a big step forward for workers across the nation. I want to thank the many hundreds of workers at Amazon fulfillment centers all across this country who contacted us and spoke up.
1305,Sanders,"This is what the political revolution is all about: today 350,000 Amazon workers found out they are getting a raise to at least $15 an hour."
1306,Sanders,"What Mr. Bezos has done today is not only enormously important for Amazon‚Äôs hundreds of thousands of employees, it could well be a shot heard around the world. I urge corporate leaders around the country to follow Mr. Bezos' lead."
1307,Sanders,"I want to congratulate Jeff Bezos for doing exactly the right thing by raising the minimum wage at Amazon and Whole Foods to $15 an hour.Let me thank the hundreds of Amazon workers who contacted my office and the Fight for $15 movement, which has been leading this effort."
1308,Sanders,Sen. Sanders holds press conference on Amazon $15 minimum wage:
1309,Sanders,"If Brett Kavanaugh knew about Deborah Ramirez's allegation of sexual assault before the publication of the Sept. 23 New Yorker story, then he lied to Congress. That's a federal crime."
1310,Sanders,One year ago 58 people were killed and 800 injured by a gunman in Las Vegas. My thoughts are with those victims' families today. We have got to prevent more innocent Americans from becoming victims of gun violence by passing commonsense gun safety legislation.
1311,Sanders,"No, Mr. President. Dr. Ford's allegations are not a ""con job."" We believe her. Brett Kavanaugh does not belong on the Supreme Court."
1312,Sanders,"While the country has been fixated on the Kavanaugh nomination, House Republicans just passed another tax cut windfall for the wealthy, as if their $2 trillion giveaway last year wasn't enough."
1313,Sanders,".@AdyBarkan has been battling terminal ALS, but he's been spending the last year to educate the public on why health care should be a right. He is a true American hero."
1314,Sanders,"After a SeaWorld trainer was drowned by a killer whale in 2010, Judge Kavanaugh said the company should be immune from penalty."
1315,Sanders,Trump and Ted Cruz love to say that they‚Äôll protect Americans with pre-exisiting conditions. So why do they keep pushing policies that do the opposite?
1316,Sanders,Fox News heard out an alleged alien abductee after spending a week doubting Christine Blasy Ford's allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.
1317,Sanders,"If Scotland can demand that Amazon get off corporate welfare and pay its workers a living wage, then so can the United States."
1318,Sanders,"When faced with allegations of sexual assault, Brett Kavanaugh took a page from Donald Trump's playbook."
1319,Sanders,Danny Glover wants to tell you why democracy is under threat in Brazil.
1320,Sanders,"Kavanaugh claimed he didn't drink on weeknights but an entry on his calendar for Thursday July 1 states, ‚ÄúGo to Timmy‚Äôs for Skis w/ Judge, Tom, Pj, Bernie, Squi.‚Äù Kavanaugh clarified to Sen. Booker that ‚ÄúSkis‚Äù referred to beer. Was Kavanaugh's original statement truthful? (10/10)"
1321,Sanders,"Kavanaugh claimed that he and Dr. Ford ‚Äúdid not travel in the same social circles.‚Äù Dr. Ford said she dated Chris Garrett, referenced as a friend in his yearbook. In fact she testified Garrett introduced her to Kavanaugh. (9/x)"
1322,Sanders,Judge Kavanaugh testified he treated women ‚Äúas friends and equals‚Äù and ‚Äúwith dignity and respect.‚Äù Numerous entries in his school yearbook would seem to contradict this. Was Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs statement to the committee truthful? (8/x)
1323,Sanders,"Kavanaugh repeatedly told the committee he never drank to the point where he didn‚Äôt remember something. He also denied ever becoming aggressive when he drinks. There have been many reports from Kavanaugh's high school, college and law school classmates that contradict this. (7/x)"
1324,Sanders,"Kavanaugh testified before the committee that he did not believe polygraphs were reliable. In 2016 he wrote, ‚ÄúThe Government has satisfactorily explained how polygraph examinations serve law enforcement purposes.‚Äù What changed his opinion or was he misleading the committee? (6/x)"
1325,Sanders,"In 2006 Judge Kavanaugh testified, ‚ÄúI was not involved and am not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants.‚Äù New evidence released as part of these confirmation hearing contradicts that assertion. (5/x)"
1326,Sanders,In 2004 Judge Kavanaugh testified the nomination of William Pryor to the 11th Circuit ‚Äúwas not one that I worked on personally.‚Äù Documents now contradict that statement. (4/x)
1327,Sanders,In 2006 Kavanaugh told Congress he didn't know anything about the NSA warrantless wiretapping program prior to it being reported by the NYT. This year an email revealed that while at the White House he might have been involved in some conversations about this program. (3/x)
1328,Sanders,Kavanaugh was asked more than 100 times if he knew about files stolen by Republican staffers from Judiciary Committee Democrats. He said he knew nothing. Newly released emails show that these files were regularly shared with Kavanaugh while he was on the WH staff. (2/x)
1329,Sanders,The FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh must include a review of his numerous untruthful statements in his previous testimony before Congress. Lying to Congress is a federal crime. Here are his statements that appear to not be true: (1/x)
1330,Sanders,"If @ChuckGrassley and Senate Republicans are concerned a thorough FBI investigation would delay this confirmation process, remember that you refused to allow the Senate to consider Merrick Garland‚Äôs nomination for nearly a year."
1331,Sanders,Lying to Congress is a federal crime.The FBI must examine the veracity of Kavanaugh‚Äôs statements under oath in addition to the sexual assault allegations against him. Kavanaugh's truthfulness with the Senate goes to the very heart of whether he should be confirmed to the court.
1332,Sanders,"""This Judiciary Committee is no longer an independent, equal branch of government. We're no longer that. We're an arm, and a very weak arm, of the Trump White House."" ‚Äì@SenatorLeahy"
1333,Sanders,Brett Kavanaugh lied repeatedly to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He does not belong on the Supreme Court.
1334,Sanders,A man who uses the same hostile and aggressive tactics as Donald Trump when faced with credible allegations of sexual assault does not deserve a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court.
1335,Sanders,"I listened to Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. I believe Dr. Ford. Brett Kavanaugh does not belong on the Supreme Court.If Judge Kavanaugh wants to clear his name of these serious charges he should demand an FBI investigation. If not, the Senate must reject his nomination."
1336,Sanders,.@SenatorDurbin asked Judge Kavanaugh if he would support an FBI investigation to clear his name. He refused to answer.
1337,Sanders,"Senator Dick Durbin: ""With what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?""Dr. Christine Blasey Ford: ""100 percent."""
1338,Sanders,We should not be attacking and disparaging the women who have come forward with serious allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. Trump's comments are disgusting.
1339,Sanders,"Today we need to remember: Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and the others who have come forward have done so with incredible courage, fully knowing that their character would be attacked and terrible things said about them. Their lives will never be the same. We owe them our respect."
1340,Sanders,"If President Trump is afraid of what an FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh will confirm or uncover, then the nomination should be withdrawn."
1341,Sanders,Trump and Judge Kavanaugh have two options. Trump can withdraw Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. Or Kavanaugh himself can call for an FBI investigation if he truly believes the allegations are false.
1342,Sanders,"We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Here's why."
1343,Sanders,For far too many people it's too difficult to get to the polls. We need to make it much easier for everyone to participate in the democratic process. Election Day should be a national holiday.
1344,Sanders,Congratulations to Seattle for clearing past misdemeanor convictions for marijuana possession that were prosecuted before marijuana was legalized. We must decriminalize marijuana nationally and expunge federal marijuana use and possession crimes.
1345,Sanders,Jeff Bezos is the wealthiest person in the world. It is not enough for him to offer 25 cents-an-hour wage increases to employees making grossly inadequate wages.There is no reason why Bezos and Amazon cannot pay workers $15 an hour plus decent benefits.
1346,Sanders,"Mayor @CarmenYulinCruz is a doing a great job in standing up for the people of Puerto Rico. How outrageous is it that the president is opposing Puerto Rican statehood, a major decision, simply because of his views on one local leader?"
1347,Sanders,"Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez have risked their lives to come forward and tell their stories. Republican Senators, their staff and the Trump administration must stop disparaging these brave women and treat them with respect."
1348,Sanders,"If Brett Kavanaugh refuses to withdraw from consideration for the Supreme Court following these two very serious allegations of sexual assault, then the Senate Judiciary Committee must postpone any votes on his nomination until a full and fair investigation is conducted."
1349,Sanders,"A moral society does not give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, and then cut back support for struggling seniors or people with disabilities."
1350,Sanders,Amazon is driving down wages. Here's how:
1351,Sanders,PhRMA lobbying to increase the price of life-saving prescription drugs for seniors in a bill to help address the opioid epidemic is a perfect example of what is wrong with Washington D.C.
1352,Sanders,"Today we learned that the State Department's legislative affairs staff is led by a former lobbyist for arms manufacturer Raytheon. This is how the billionaire class profits off of the devastation of Yemen, the poorest country in the Middle East."
1353,Sanders,"The President's statement to discredit Christine Blasey Ford is sexist, outrageous and based on ignorance. Dr. Blasey is a credible person who has made a very serious allegation. She must be treated with respect and not face intimidation."
1354,Sanders,This former Apple software engineer is calling out his former company for spending $100 billion in stock buybacks after saving billions of dollars from the Republican tax scam.
1355,Sanders,"The Trump administration must reverse this decision. We cannot make cuts to essential and life-saving programs to pay for their racist, xenophobic"
1356,Sanders,"Trump's former chief economic advisor Gary Cohn seems to have a bit of amnesia. He recently asked the question, ""What laws were broken?"" when asked about the big banks who crashed our economy in 2008. Let's refresh his memory:"
1357,Sanders,"If Scotland can demand that Amazon get off corporate welfare and pay its workers a living wage, then so can the US. Now is the time for people to come together around the world to take on the greed of the oligarchs."
1358,Sanders,"Today, our illustrious president said that Medicare for all ""can't be afforded."" Mr. President, it's your disastrous efforts to take health care away from millions of Americans that can't be afforded."
1359,Sanders,Mr. Pompeo: human lives are worth far more than defense contractor profits. We must end America's involvement in this disastrous and unconstitutional war. The Senate must also investigate this effort to mislead us.
1360,Sanders,"One year since #HurricaneMaria, the people of Puerto Rico are still suffering. We must use the full resources of the US government to not only help the island recover, but to go forward and create a strong, sustainable economy and energy system."
1361,Sanders,"If Trump was serious about protecting good American jobs, which he is not, he would sign an executive order today to deny federal contracts to companies that outsource American jobs overseas."
1362,Sanders,Listen to @RepDebDingell. Social Security must be protected at all costs. We are not going to leave our fellow Americans behind.
1363,Sanders,"If Canada and every other major country on earth can guarantee paid leave, so can the United States. We must end this international embarrassment. (With @MadeleineSix)"
1364,Sanders,"A few years ago, a $15 minimum wage was considered a radical, fringe and unrealistic idea. Not so much anymore. This is what the political revolution is all about."
1365,Sanders,"Gary Cohn, the former President of Goldman Sachs and Trump‚Äôs former chief economic advisor, wants to know who on Wall Street broke the law. Well, let‚Äôs refresh Gary‚Äôs memory."
1366,Sanders,40% of fast-food workers have reported experiencing sexual harassment. That is simply unacceptable. We must stand with the brave McDonald‚Äôs workers walking out today to demand the company address this epidemic of sexual harassment.
1367,Sanders,I sat down with my friend @SarahKSilverman to explain what democratic socialism means to me. Watch the full interview here: https://t.co/F7Y6yvg166
1368,Sanders,"Donald Trump claims Democrats want to ""destroy your Social Security.‚Äù Surprise! He's lying. His own economic advisor just admitted the Trump administration is looking at cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid next year."
1369,Sanders,"While 1 in 5 seniors are scraping by on less than $13,500/year, our job is not to cut Social Security. Our job: expand Social Security so that every American can retire with dignity, and every person with a disability can live with the security they need."
1370,Sanders,"""If you want to understand what a turn of the century 20th century sweatshop looks like, all you've got to do is go to an Amazon warehouse for a day."" -James, former Amazon employee"
1371,Sanders,"How Amazon got to be so powerful, and what it means for our economy:"
1372,Sanders,We are with everyone who is being hit by Hurricane Florence. We are one nation and our job is to stand together and help each other out when disasters hit.
1373,Sanders,The allegation from Professor Christine Blasey Ford is a serious one that deserves a full investigation. Neither the Judiciary Committee nor the full Senate should vote on Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination to the Supreme Court until that takes place.
1374,Sanders,"While Trump and Paul Ryan continue their attempts to destroy Social Security, 150 of my colleagues and I launched the Expand Social Security Caucus yesterday to make sure seniors can retire in dignity."
1375,Sanders,Workers have a constitutional right to form a union and negotiate for better wages and working conditions. But what we are seeing all over the country is profitable corporations like Delta doing everything they can to prevent that.
1376,Sanders,"We are far, far past the point of arguing about whether climate change is real. Our job now: do everything we can to protect people from the disasters to come, and work relentlessly to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels."
1377,Sanders,"Yesterday the President of the United States lied about the deaths of thousands of American citizens for his own personal gain.Mr. President, try working with the people of Puerto Rico for a change, not against them."
1378,Sanders,"Every single worker in this country has a right to a safe workplace where they will not be harassed, assaulted or punished for speaking up. We all must stand with the McDonald's workers who are bravely fighting back."
1379,Sanders,"""The theme behind this bill is to get middle-class tax relief."" ‚ÄìMitch McConnell ""The entire purpose of this is to lower middle class taxes."" ‚ÄìPaul Ryan""Primarily, and priority number 1, is middle-class Americans."" ‚ÄìSarah Huckabee"
1380,Sanders,"AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson promised to create ""7,000 good jobs for the middle class"" after Trump's tax cut was passed, yet the company has been laying off thousands of workers and shipping those jobs overseas to countries where workers can be paid less than $2 an hour."
1381,Sanders,"Mr. President, instead of denying the death toll that resulted from Hurricane Maria, why don't you actually work with the people of Puerto Rico to create the future the island needs?"
1382,Sanders,"In order to effectively combat the rise of the international authoritarian axis, we need an international progressive movement that mobilizes behind a vision of shared prosperity, security and dignity for all people."
1383,Sanders,"Mr. President, instead of denying the toll that Hurricane Maria took on Puerto Rico and attacking @CarmenYulinCruz, who is fighting for her people, why don‚Äôt you help her rebuild the island, new housing, good schools and sustainable energy."
1384,Sanders,"The Archbishop of Canterbury is right. It is unacceptable that companies like Amazon pay workers wages so low that they have to rely on government programs just to survive, while paying nothing in federal income taxes."
1385,Sanders,"One year ago, we introduced #MedicareForAll to guarantee health care to everyone.Today, because of your hard work, 70% of the American people support Medicare for All, including a majority of Republicans.Together, we will make health care a right, not a privilege!"
1386,Sanders,"We are not going to let Social Security be destroyed. Today, 18 senators and 140 House members are founding the Expand Social Security Caucus to make sure seniors can retire in dignity.Hear that, Paul Ryan?"
1387,Sanders,There are five times as many kids in child detention centers now than there were a year ago.Let me repeat that. There are FIVE TIMES as many children locked up and separated from their families than at this time last year.
1388,Sanders,"While the country is bracing for a massive hurricane, the last thing Trump should be doing is attacking the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz, who fought for the people of Puerto Rico after the destruction of Hurricane Maria while he played golf with his billionaire friends."
1389,Sanders,"This is outrageous. The Saudi-led war on Yemen is killing thousands of people, including a school bus full of children last month. America's role should not simply be to help our Saudi clients manage the slaughter more responsibly; we need to stop supporting it altogether."
1390,Sanders,"Trump tweeted this morning he did a ""great job"" handling the hurricane crisis in Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, new estimates put the Hurricane Maria death toll at nearly 3,000. What a disgrace."
1391,Sanders,"Today while we remember the lives lost on 9/11, we must also honor the courageous men and women who continue to serve and die in Afghanistan, Iraq and many other places, and consider whether these wars‚Äîthe longest in our history‚Äîhave made us safer."
1392,Sanders,"When it comes to health care, education, protecting our environment and rebuilding our infrastructure, Republicans say we simply don't have the money.But when it comes to giving tax breaks to billionaires and corporations, the sky is the limit!"
1393,Sanders,"Nearly 3,000 people died. That is not a ‚Äúsuccess.‚Äù That is a tragedy and a disgrace."
1394,Sanders,Crystal Mason is going to prison for voting. The voter suppression in this country is out of control.
1395,Sanders,"We must not only work to end terrorist violence. We must fight the conditions that give rise to it: corruption, authoritarianism, inequality and ethnic and religious hatred."
1396,Sanders,"If this is the wealthiest country on Earth, why are one in five American adults skipping medical care because they can't afford it?Answer: our health care system is built to make corporate profits ‚Äî not give people the care they need. #MedicareForAll"
1397,Sanders,Methane is a greenhouse gas 86 TIMES more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.President Trump is apparently comfortable with the destruction of our planet if it means he can hand favors to fossil fuel industry billionaires.
1398,Sanders,"Today we remember the nearly 3,000 lives lost on 9/11 and many brave people who risked their lives that day to help. Those acts of selfless sacrifice speak to the very best of us as a nation‚Äîwe are a people prepared to come together and work for the good of our fellow Americans."
1399,Sanders,Congratulations to everyone in California who successfully pushed for this incredibly important law to move the state‚Äôs electric grid to 100% clean energy by no later than 2045. This bill is a step in the right direction.
1400,Sanders,"The great economic crisis of our time is that millions of American workers earn starvation wages. Large, profitable corporations owned by multi-billionaires should provide their employees with a living wage and decent working conditions."
1401,Sanders,Child care should not cost parents more than sending their kids to college. We need a revolution in child care in this country.
1402,Sanders,"Listen to how Amazon uses its own lingo to blur the distinction between billionaire CEO Jeff Bezos and the average Amazon employee making minimum wage, according to journalist @J_Bloodworth."
1403,Sanders,"We cannot have a Supreme Court Justice like Brett Kavanaugh‚Äîan extreme, right-wing nominee who will endanger the future of our planet."
1404,Sanders,"Last week I introduced a bill to give billionaires like Bezos and the Waltons a choice: pay workers a living wage, or pay for the public assistance your low-wage workers rely on."
1405,Sanders,The crisis we face as a country is not voter fraud. It is voter suppression.
1406,Sanders,"Mr. President, stop the lying. Last I heard, it was your own budget that cut Social Security and Medicare, not the Democrats."
1407,Sanders,"If we are bold, if we have the courage to take on the fossil fuel industry, if we are prepared to invest in sustainable energy, we can make the necessary changes to save the planet. And that‚Äôs exactly what we have to do. #RiseForClimate"
1408,Sanders,".@JimCarrey is right. If Canada can provide health care to everyone, the U.S. can too. #MedicareForAll"
1409,Sanders,"Last night, Trump was in Montana, telling people that Democrats want to ""destroy your Social Security"" and are ""going to ruin your Medicare.""Really? That's funny..."
1410,Sanders,"The issue about Amazon is not just that the wealthiest person on earth, Jeff Bezos, is paying workers unlivable wages. It's about the ""new economy"" and the degradation of the human spirit‚Äîbreaking down people, spitting them out and simply replacing them with new bodies."
1411,Sanders,Thank you President Obama for supporting Medicare for All. His support takes us another step toward ensuring that no one in the richest country in the history of the world has to forego health care because they cannot afford it.
1412,Sanders,"Our job now is to energize people, revitalize American democracy and fight for a government that will work for all of us, and not the wealthy few."
1413,Sanders,"This week we have seen more and more evidence of President Trump‚Äôs dangerous disregard for the democratic norms of our country, and stunning revelations about his erratic and misguided policy decisions and his pathological lying. We live in dangerous and unprecedented times."
1414,Sanders,"Although Trump thinks his administration did a ""fantastic job"" handling the destruction in Puerto Rico, the crisis is far from over."
1415,Sanders,Did you know that your tax dollars are subsidizing CEOs' outrageous compensation?
1416,Sanders,"While we have more people in jail than any country, we are beginning to make progress on criminal justice reform. There is still a long way to go in creating a justice system that works for all, but we should celebrate the steps we are taking."
1417,Sanders,"Eight months later, it's clear that Trump's tax cuts are only working for the billionaire class and wealthy CEOs."
1418,Sanders,We cannot go back to the days when people could be denied insurance due to a pre-existing condition. We will fight any Republican efforts to end these protections.
1419,Sanders,"At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, and when millions of our fellow Americans are working at starvation wages, we must create an economy that works for all ‚Äî not just the people on"
1420,Sanders,"Nothing is more important now than doing everything in our power to stop this nomination, and protecting the constitutional right of women to control their own bodies."
1421,Sanders,Brett Kavanaugh was asked if the president has the power to pardon himself. He refused to answer.
1422,Sanders,"Amazon workers are urinating in bottles because they're afraid of failing to meet productivity targets, according to @J_Bloodworth who went undercover at an Amazon warehouse in the UK."
1423,Sanders,"If McDonald's can find the money to spend over $20 billion on stock buybacks, they can find the money to pay their workers a living wage. It is time we stop subsidizing McDonald‚Äôs starvation wages."
1424,Sanders,Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is a dire threat to:-Abortion rights-Campaign finance reform-Voting rights-Workers' rights-Health care-Climate change-Environmental protection-Gun safetyHe cannot be given a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court.
1425,Sanders,"The Walton family of Walmart is the wealthiest family in the country, worth nearly $175 billion. Meanwhile, Walmart pays its workers wages so low that many of them are forced to depend upon public assistance programs."
1426,Sanders,WATCH LIVE: Introducing the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (BEZOS) Act
1427,Sanders,Let's be clear: the government has a moral responsibility to provide for the vulnerable. But taxpayers should not have to expend huge sums of money subsidizing profitable corporations owned by some of the wealthiest people in the country and the world.
1428,Sanders,"If employers in this country simply paid workers a living wage, taxpayers would save about $150 billion a year on federal assistance programs and millions of workers would be able to live in dignity and security."
1429,Sanders,"It's time to get Jeff Bezos, the Waltons and other billionaires who won't pay a living wage off of welfare. Today I'm introducing legislation to give them a choice: pay workers a living wage, or pay for the public assistance your low-wage workers rely"
1430,Sanders,The public still doesn‚Äôt have 96% of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs documents. What are Republicans hiding?
1431,Sanders,"Amazon is worth $1 TRILLION.Jeff Bezos is worth $155 BILLION.Thousands of Amazon workers have to rely on food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive. That is what a rigged economy looks like. Tomorrow we will introduce a bill to end subsidies for low-wage employers."
1432,Sanders,"President Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in a crime. We should not confirm his Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a man who believes the president cannot be indicted or deposed."
1433,Sanders,"What is the Trump administration trying to hide about Brett Kavanaugh? If Republicans believe he deserves a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, they must stop hiding his records and release all of his documents."
1434,Sanders,"The trade union movement has led the fight for equal rights and economic and social justice. Today, Labor Day, we reflect on those struggles, and pledge our support to protecting workers‚Äô rights and building an economy based on human needs, not corporate greed."
1435,Sanders,"I said it in 1992 and not much seems to have changed. By and large, the Congress is owned by big money interests and the largest corporations in America."
1436,Sanders,"If Amazon is so proud of the way it treats its workers, why won‚Äôt it make public the number of people it hires through temporary staffing agencies like Integrity Staffing Solutions and the hourly rate and benefits those workers earn?"
1437,Sanders,"The median Amazon employee makes $13.67 an hour.Many of those employees rely on food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive.You know who pays for that? You do.You know what Jeff Bezos makes every hour? $10,833,33It's time for Amazon to get off corporate welfare."
1438,Sanders,"""I am fully convinced that the success of Amazon is actually created by the sheer terror of pushing people to the extreme."" - Werner Cox, former Amazon manager."
1439,Sanders,"On September 5, we are going to introduce legislation to end the absurdity of middle-class taxpayers having to subsidize billionaires like Jeff Bezos."
1440,Sanders,"President Trump said yesterday he did a ""fantastic job"" in Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, new estimates put the death toll from Hurricane Maria at nearly 3,000. This is a disgrace."
1441,Sanders,".@amazon, if our claims about wages and working conditions at Amazon are inaccurate then prove it. Make public the number of people you hire through temporary staffing agencies like Integrity Staffing Solutions and make public the hourly rate and benefits those workers earn."
1442,Sanders,"A question for Amazon: If you‚Äôre so proud of the way you treat your workers, why are you relying on so many temporary workers who receive low wages, unreliable schedules and no benefits?"
1443,Sanders,"Amazon‚Äôs warehouses are one of the most dangerous places to work in the U.S. According to the NCOSH, seven Amazon workers have died on or near the job since 2013. I will be asking OSHA to investigate unsafe working conditions at Amazon fulfillment centers."
1444,Sanders,"Amazon is paying some of its employees to tweet positive stories about the company. Hmm, why is that?"
1445,Sanders,Bottom line: No one working for the wealthiest person on Earth should have to rely on food stamps. No one working for a man who earns $260 million a day should be forced to sleep in their car. Yet that is what's happening at Amazon. My full response: https://t.co/NQsi47qINt
1446,Sanders,"The Trump administration recently said the War on Poverty is ‚Äúlargely over and a success.‚Äù Honestly, I do not know what world they are living in."
1447,Sanders,"The American people are subsidizing Amazon workers‚Äô food stamps while their boss, Jeff Bezos, is the richest man in the world. It‚Äôs time to get Mr. Bezos off of welfare."
1448,Sanders,This is a catastrophic loss of American lives. The Trump administration's response to the crisis in Puerto Rico has been disturbingly inadequate. We must use the full resources of the United States government to help the island recover.
1449,Sanders,"Just 3% of Brett Kavanaugh's records have been released. If Republicans believe Kavanaugh deserves a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, why are they afraid to show the American people what Kavanaugh has written?"
1450,Sanders,The Founding Fathers were fundamentally opposed to the kind of predatory lenders leeching off student borrowers today.
1451,Sanders,We know our health care system is profoundly broken when a family has to file for bankrupcy for saving their newborn's life.
1452,Sanders,Are you a current or former Amazon employee? Please share your experiences with Sen. Bernie Sanders.
1453,Sanders,Those of us who believe in democracy must understand the scope of the challenge of authoritarianism if we are to effectively confront it.
1454,Sanders,"Billionaires shouldn't be on welfare. If the owners of large, profitable corporations won't pay workers a living wage, then we are going to tax them for 100% of the public assistance benefits their workers are forced to rely on."
1455,Sanders,Congratulations to the courageous workers and their unions at Disney World for their historic victory. I applaud everyone who stood up to demand that workers at one of the wealthiest corporations in the world should have a decent standard of living.
1456,Sanders,"John McCain was an American hero, a man of decency and honor and a friend of mine. He will be missed not just in the U.S. Senate but by all Americans who respect integrity and independence. Jane and I send our deepest condolences to his family."
1457,Sanders,"Instead of paying people to tweet positive things about his corporation, Jeff Bezos needs to get off welfare, improve working conditions at Amazon's warehouses and pay his workers a living wage."
1458,Sanders,"There is something fundamentally wrong when thousands of Amazon workers are on food stamps while their boss, Jeff Bezos, is the richest man in the world."
1459,Sanders,"While Jeff Bezos' wealth has increased $260 million every single day this year, he continues to pay many Amazon employees wages so low that they're forced to depend on taxpayer-funded programs such as food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive."
1460,Sanders,Incredible. According to a new poll 70 percent of Americans now support Medicare for all‚Äîincluding 52 percent of Republicans! The momentum is with us.
1461,Sanders,"Betsy DeVos has a brilliant idea. While paltry school budgets deny kids a decent education, she may let states use federal funds to buy guns for educators‚Äînot books, computers or pay raises. Guns. Meanwhile the Trump administration opposes all commonsense gun safety legislation."
1462,Sanders,The Koch brothers-funded Mercatus Center might not like that their report revealed Medicare for all will save Americans $2 trillion. But numbers don't lie.
1463,Sanders,"At a time when Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in a crime, we shouldn‚Äôt confirm a Supreme Court justice picked by Trump, who believes the president cannot be indicted or deposed. The Senate must postpone Kavanaugh‚Äôs hearings until the ongoing investigations are complete."
1464,Sanders,Americans deserve to know the truth about the 2016 election. Any attempt by the president to interfere with Special Counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs investigation or pardon Cohen or Manafort would be a very serious offense.
1465,Sanders,President Trump's associates who have pleaded guilty to or been convicted of serious crimes ‚Äì so far:- His campaign chairman- His deputy campaign chairman- His lawyer- His national security advisor- His foreign policy advisors
1466,Sanders,Imagine proposing a plan that you know will kill thousands of Americans every year.That's exactly what Donald Trump's EPA just did.
1467,Sanders,Trump is actively destroying the planet in order to enrich his billionaire friends in the fossil fuel industry. We must fight back.
1468,Sanders,Here it is! A leading Republican just admitted that they plan to cut Medicare and Social Security to pay for the massive tax cuts they gave billionaires and large corporations. https://t.co/W3YiLCfnyo
1469,Sanders,"Our health care system isn't designed to provide quality, cost-effective care for all. It exists to make profits for insurance companies, drug companies and medical equipment suppliers. That must change. #MedicareForAll"
1470,Sanders,This teacher is one of many millions of Americans saddled with insurmountable student debt. It‚Äôs time to make college tuition free in America.
1471,Sanders,"11) So, the question that must be asked is why would the corporate media would put their blind faith in a far right-wing economist whose past reports have been so thoroughly discredited by mainstream economists and experts?"
1472,Sanders,"10) But instead of talking to any of these experts, the corporate fact checkers are blindly trusting the author of the Mercatus report even though his previous studies have been called ‚Äúmisleading,‚Äù ‚Äúarbitrary,‚Äù ‚Äúdiscredited,‚Äù ‚Äúmighty odd‚Äù and ‚Äúbogus.‚Äù"
1473,Sanders,"9) Ernie Tedeschi, a former economist at the Treasury Department has also pointed out that the Mercatus study shows that Medicare for All will reduce national health expenditures by $2 trillion over 10 years."
1474,Sanders,"8) The founder of Medicare Rights Center says, ""Blahous concedes that Medicare for All would reduce national health spending by $2 trillion over 10 years, even after accounting for the cost of guaranteeing everyone coverage and offering better benefits."""
1475,Sanders,"7) Harold Pollack at the University of Chicago said: ""Over the long run, the Sanders people are very correct that you could implement a system like this that would be more disciplined, more economical and more fair than the current U.S. health system."""
1476,Sanders,6) @MattBruenig has found that payments to medical providers would only go down by 10.6% under Medicare for All (not 40%) which could be more than made up for by the administrative savings that would be achieved.
1477,Sanders,"5) @swoolhandler and @awgaffney have found that even though the Mercatus study ‚Äúgrossly underestimates the main sources of savings‚Äù from Medicare for All, the ‚Äúcentral finding‚Äù from the study is that it saves Americans $2 trillion over a decade."
1478,Sanders,4) This isn't just Bernie talking. @JeffDSachs found that Medicare for All could save Americans a lot more than the $2 trillion in the Mercatus Center report.
1479,Sanders,3) What Tapper and others have done is say we're wrong because Blahous didn't actually intend to find that Medicare for All would be a great deal for Americans. The problem is: Blahous did find it would save $2 trillion ‚Äì he just doesn't like that people are celebrating it.
1480,Sanders,...Any score that replaces Medicare reimbursement rates with some other set of rates is not a score of our plan.
1481,Sanders,"2) Tapper says, ‚ÄúThe study‚Äôs author says that that $2 trillion drop is not actually his conclusion. He says that‚Äôs based on assumptions by Senator Sanders.‚Äù Wrong. Provider payment rates in our plan are not assumptions, they are written into the bill..."
1482,Sanders,1) We correctly state that the Mercatus report found that the American people would save $2 trillion over 10 years under Medicare for All. That finding is right here in Table 2 of the Mercatus study.
1483,Sanders,"I thank @jaketapper for admitting his ‚Äúfact check‚Äù on Medicare for All was not factual and editing his video. Sadly, Tapper's video on Medicare for All along with other ‚Äúfact checks‚Äù is riddled with errors peddled by the Koch-funded Mercatus Center. Let's go through them:"
1484,Sanders,McDonald's just announced it is spending $6 billion on makeovers of its restaurants while still refusing to pay its workers a living wage.
1485,Sanders,"The good news is, the ideas that we have been talking about‚ÄîMedicare for all, making public colleges and universities tuition-free, leaving a healthy planet for our kids and grandkids‚Äîare now mainstream ideas supported by the vast majority of the American people."
1486,Sanders,"This must not go unnoticed. The Trump administration just announced their extremely dangerous plan to repeal the Clean Power Plan. Mr. Trump: You are threatening not only this generation, but you're threatening the lives of our children and"
1487,Sanders,"Our job: Overturn Citizens United, move to the public funding of elections and create an economy and political system that works for all of us, not just the top 1 percent."
1488,Sanders,"This is how our rigged system works:1) Republicans give huge tax breaks to their wealthy campaign contributors2) Billionaires spend millions to elect Republicans3) Republicans push cuts to Social Security, Medicare &amp; Medicaid to make the rich richer and everyone else poorer"
1489,Sanders,The cost of college has increased astronomically in just one generation. This isn't sustainable. We need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
1490,Sanders,What Trump and his friends in the fossil fuel industry are doing is criminal.
1491,Sanders,"Poverty is not a crime and hundreds of thousands of Americans, convicted of nothing, should not be in jail today because they cannot afford bail. with @CFBurdeen and @shaunking"
1492,Sanders,"Remember: our ""crazy idea"" of universal health care is a reality in:AustraliaAustriaBelgiumCanadaChileCzech Rep.DenmarkFinlandFranceGermanyGreeceHungaryIcelandIsraelItalyJapanNetherlandsNew ZealandNorwayPolandPortugalS. KoreaSpainSwedenSwitz.TurkeyU.K."
1493,Sanders,"Listen to this historian explain why Trump chants ""Build That Wall!"" (with @TimothyDSnyder)"
1494,Sanders,"Today, we remember and celebrate the life of one of the great entertainers in modern American history. Aretha, thank you for all that you have given us. You will not be forgotten."
1495,Sanders,"While thousands of Americans die each year because they lack access to health care they need, the top five health insurance companies last year made $21 billion in profits. We need a health care system that works for all, not just the wealthy."
1496,Sanders,I think there is a growing understanding that there is something fundamentally wrong when three people in America own more wealth than the bottom half of the country.
1497,Sanders,A year. It took nearly a year to restore power in Puerto Rico after the devastation of Hurricane Maria.The way the Trump administration has handled this crisis is an international
1498,Sanders,"I said it in 1993 and I will say it again now: If you want a simpler, more cost-effective health care system, the way forward is a Medicare for all, single-payer program."
1499,Sanders,Enough is enough! No one in America should go deeply in debt or bankrupt for the crime of getting an education. It is time to reduce the burden of student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition free.
1500,Sanders,"No, Secretary Zinke. The record-breaking wildfires in California have everything to do with climate change. We must confront the reality that climate change is already destroying tens of thousands of lives, and take concrete steps to avoid its worst consequences."
1501,Sanders,"A year ago, countless people were injured protesting white supremacy and Neo-Naziism in Charlottesville and and one person, Heather Heyer, was killed. Today, we honor Heather, and all who stood up to hate, by recommitting ourselves to fighting all forms of racism and bigotry."
1502,Sanders,Medicare for all would save both dollars and lives compared to our current profit-driven system. It‚Äôs time to join every other major country and guarantee health care for all.
1503,Sanders,"Maybe, just maybe, we should make sure our people are not dying because they lack health insurance before we start spending billions to militarize outer space. #SpaceForce"
1504,Sanders,Here's how Trump's world of fiction is undermining our democracy and how we can fight back:
1505,Sanders,"By backing the Saudi coalition‚Äôs war in Yemen with weapons, aerial refueling, and targeting assistance, the United States is complicit in this atrocity. No one can seriously claim that our support for this war is actually making us safer."
1506,Sanders,"The U.S. has a president who is so ""tough"" that he can order tiny kids to be torn from their parents' arms. Unfortunately, he's not so tough that he can speak out on human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a leader who sounded more like @JustinTrudeau."
1507,Sanders,It's never been more clear who the Trump Administration is really working
1508,Sanders,"""There are so many medical GoFundMe pages at this point that I can't imagine if pre-existing condition protections got repealed. We'd all be asking our family and friends for money."" ‚ÄîSarah Rentz, 32 year old breast cancer survivor."
1509,Sanders,"Trump makes racist attacks on LeBron James, as well as many other black athletes, to feel powerful and divide us up. Congratulations to LeBron on opening the I Promise school‚Äîsetting a great example for the young people of our country, unlike the"
1510,Sanders,"This is an outrageous move. It's entirely legitimate for democratic governments to highlight human rights issues with undemocratic governments. We must continue to do so. The US must be clear in condemning repression, especially when done by governments that receive our support."
1511,Sanders,"Despite Trump‚Äôs tax giveaway to the wealthy and large corporations, real wages have actually gone down, not up, since June 2017. The economy may be the best in history for billionaires like Jeff Bezos, but it is not ""booming"" for the average worker."
1512,Sanders,"We cannot continue to have a ""debtor prison"" system in the United States. Our destructive and unjust cash bail process is part of our broken criminal justice system and it must be ended."
1513,Sanders,Trump claimed that you need a photo ID to buy groceries. What he's actually doing is making the case for voter suppression.
1514,Sanders,"While Jeff Bezos spends $12 million renovating his 5th mansion, this Amazon employee is forced to live out of her car."
1515,Sanders,"Trump promised a nation of ""law and order"" and to be ""tough on crime."" So why is he letting corporate criminals off the hook?"
1516,Sanders,"A cancer patient should be able to focus all their time and energy on their road to recovery. Instead, this single mom had to worry about $160,000 in medical bills. We need #MedicareForAll."
1517,Sanders,"No matter what Fox News comes up with to try to discredit Medicare for all, a majority of the American people have made it clear time and time again that we should join every other major country and make health care a right."
1518,Sanders,Fox News wants you to believe that Medicare for All will limit your intake of donuts. Here's why they're wrong:
1519,Sanders,"Even with private health insurance, Kim Leighton is still paying thousands of dollars for life-saving health care. Our system is broken. We need Medicare for all."
1520,Sanders,"What insurance company CEOs made in 2017:-Leonard Schleifer (Regeneron): $95.3 million-Dave Wichmann (UnitedHealth): $83.2 million-Mark Bertolini (Aetna): $58.7 millionWe need a system that provides health care for all, not massive compensation for a few CEOs.#MedicareForAll"
1521,Sanders,"Americans are sick and tired of our wasteful, inefficient, dysfunctional health care system. They want Medicare for all."
1522,Sanders,How does a universal health care system actually work? Hear it from Canadian doctors who have seen it firsthand.
1523,Sanders,"If Norway, along with every other major country on Earth, can make health care a right, why can't the United States do the same?"
1524,Sanders,Fox News is at it again. They can't accept what a right-wing think tank found: that Medicare for All will actually save our country trillions of dollars.
1525,Sanders,"At a time when gun violence and school shootings are becoming more and more routine, the last thing we need is to enable anyone ‚Äì including people who otherwise couldn‚Äôt legally purchase a gun ‚Äì to ‚Äòprint‚Äô a gun on a 3-D printer."
1526,Sanders,"""To anybody who thinks it‚Äôs fine to take away coverage for pre-existing conditions, you need to know that without insurance, I would probably die."" Liz Leavens is one of many people afraid of what might happen if Republicans get rid of protections for pre-existing conditions."
1527,Sanders,Here's what happened when a Republican senator challenged a Canadian doctor on their single-payer health care system.
1528,Sanders,We took some American doctors to Canada to see a universal health care system up close. Here's what they learned:
1529,Sanders,"If every major country on Earth can guarantee health care to all and achieve better health outcomes, while spending substantially less per capita, please don't tell me that the United States cannot do the same."
1530,Sanders,"Thank you, Koch brothers, for accidentally making the case for Medicare for All!"
1531,Sanders,This is the reality of what it's like to work for Amazon.
1532,Sanders,Cynthia Murray has worked at Walmart for 18 years and still doesn‚Äôt make $15 an hour. That is a disgrace.
1533,Sanders,For a company like Amazon which holds an unbelievable amount of wealth and power to treat its workers this way is simply unconscionable. This is the kind of corporate greed that is destroying the social fabric of our country.
1534,Sanders,Here are all the ways Trump has failed working families:
1535,Sanders,Even a Koch brothers-funded attempt to trash Medicare for All can't hide the truth: Medicare for All will lead to a $2 TRILLION REDUCTION in national health expenditures over 10 years. That‚Äôs trillion with a ‚ÄúT.‚Äù
1536,Sanders,If Roe v. Wade is overturned it will have an immediate impact on millions of women‚Äôs lives around the country. States are already trying to come as close to banning abortion as they possibly can.
1537,Sanders,"-40 million Americans still live in poverty-30 million have no health insurance-Half of older workers have no retirement savingsAnd what does Trump's tax plan accomplish? Make the very, very rich much richer. What a disgrace."
1538,Sanders,"""Do you know what it's like to not have food for your children?"" Listen to these two single mothers tell their stories about struggling every day just to survive in this economy."
1539,Sanders,"What a hypocrite! Given the choice between hiring American workers at a living wage or hiring much less expensive workers from China that he can exploit, Donald Trump opts for the low-wage overseas labor day in and day out."
1540,Sanders,Congratulations to the courageous workers and their unions at Disneyland for their wonderful victory. They are an inspiration to low-wage workers all over this country who are struggling for justice and dignity.
1541,Sanders,"More than 65% of the people in county or city jails on any given day in 2016 had not been convicted of a crime, often because they lack the money to pay bail. In other words, we have criminalized poverty."
1542,Sanders,Amazon just announced that they made $2.5 billion in profits last quarter. Why does Jeff Bezos still refuse to treat his workers with respect and dignity?
1543,Sanders,Great to meet today with a @CarterCenter delegation of brave human rights defenders from around the world.
1544,Sanders,"I can't believe we have to say this in the year 2018: Poverty is not a crime.Hundreds of thousands of Americans, convicted of nothing, should not be in jail because they can't afford their bail."
1545,Sanders,I met with some of Vermont's smart and talented young people - students participating in the @ALBoysNation and @ALAforVeterans Girls Nation. Looking forward to great things from these student leaders.
1546,Sanders,It's extremely concerning that the person charged with administering Medicare would rather throw 32 million Americans off of health insurance than join every major nation and guarantee health care as a fundamental right.
1547,Sanders,"It is, quite simply, a travesty that in the year 2018 we continue to have debtors‚Äô prisons in the United States."
1548,Sanders,Greedy Wall Street vulture funds must not be allowed to reap huge profits off the suffering and misery of the Puerto Rican people for a second longer.
1549,Sanders,"Hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. have not been convicted of a crime but are incarcerated because they cannot afford bail. Today, we are introducing legislation to end that disgrace."
1550,Sanders,"Poverty is not a crime and hundreds of thousands of Americans, convicted of nothing, shouldn't be in jail because they can't afford cash bail. Our destructive and unjust cash bail process is part of our broken criminal justice system and must be ended."
1551,Sanders,It is incomprehensible to me that we have a president who gave massive tax breaks to billionaires but wants to cut the WIC nutrition program for low-income pregnant women and their babies.
1552,Sanders,"Brett Kavanaugh strongly believes the president should have more power. He has written that a president should be able to ""deem"" laws unconstitutional and not enforce them. Are those really the views we want on the Supreme Court under a Trump presidency?"
1553,Sanders,"If he is confirmed, Brett Kavanaugh will be a rubber stamp on the Supreme Court for an extreme, right-wing agenda pushed by corporations and billionaires. We must do everything we can to see that he is defeated."
1554,Sanders,"Please remember that our ideas, including Medicare for all, are not radical. They are what the vast majority of the American people want."
1555,Sanders,"Before Roe v. Wade an estimated 200,000 - 1.2 million illegal abortions took place in the US every year. We cannot return to the days of back-room abortions, when countless women died or were maimed."
1556,Sanders,Thank you to the young people standing up to fossil fuel corporations and leading the movement to combat climate change. #ThisIsZeroHour
1557,Sanders,"Looks like that $4,000 pay raise Trump promised working people from his tax cuts was just another lie he told to help enrich profitable corporations and billionaires."
1558,Sanders,"I hope my Republican colleagues who believe that women, not the government, have the right to control their own bodies will stand with the overwhelming majority of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, who don't want Roe v. Wade overturned."
1559,Sanders,"Does anyone really believe Trump is concerned with human rights in Iran, when he‚Äôs had only kind things to say about authoritarians around the world, including Putin in Russia, Kim Jong Un in North Korea, Duterte in the Philippines and Mohammad Bin Salman in Saudi Arabia?"
1560,Sanders,"No, Obama improved relations with Iran. Are YOU, President Trump, planning to start a war to get re-elected?"

1562,Sanders,Private prison companies invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign. Now they are getting their reward with Trump's inhumane immigration policies and corporate tax cuts.
1563,Sanders,How does it happen that companies which are owned by some of the wealthiest people in this country have workers not making enough money to feed their families and live in dignity? That is an issue the mainstream media has got to address.
1564,Sanders,American Airlines made $1.9 billion in profits last year. Their workers should not have to rely on public assistance programs like food stamps and Medicaid to try to get by.
1565,Sanders,The average cashier at McDonald's would have to work for 895 years to make what the company's CEO makes in one year. That is simply immoral.
1566,Sanders,"Republicans have been trying to overturn Roe v Wade for more than 40 years. Now that they are on the verge of achieving their dream, they are downplaying the consequences. We‚Äôre not fooled."
1567,Sanders,"We face an unprecedented situation of a president who, for whatever reason, refuses to acknowledge the full scope of the threat to American democracy."
1568,Sanders,The United States is the only major country not to guarantee ANY paid maternity or paternity leave. That is a disgrace that has got to change. It should not depend upon the generosity of one's coworkers whether a parent is able to be with their newborn baby.
1569,Sanders,"If President Trump won't confront Putin about interference in our elections and his destabilizing policies, Congress must act. Tweets and speeches are fine, but we need more from Republican senators now."
1570,Sanders,"If Trump won't protect the U.S. from Russian interference in our elections, then my Republican colleagues must join with Democrats to make it happen or all of their tweets and speeches are worthless. I call on them to support my resolution."
1571,Sanders,I am introducing a resolution at 11:20 AM on the Senate floor to demand that the President of the United States represent the interests of the American people and not Russia. Watch here: https://t.co/zyKevj3vFl
1572,Sanders,"When millions of Americans are struggling economically, when veterans are homeless and when 1 in 5 patients can't afford the medications they need, the U.S. shouldn't have this grotesque level of inequality. This is why we need a political revolution."

1575,Sanders,"Disney, which made $9 billion in profits last year, pays its workers so little that they are living in their cars to try to survive."
1576,Sanders,"5) And finally, the Congress must make it clear to President Trump that his job is to protect the values that millions of Americans struggled, fought and died to defend: democracy, justice and equality."
1577,Sanders,"4) The Congress must make it clear that we will not accept any interference with the ongoing investigation of Special Counsel Mueller, such as the offer of preemptive pardons or the firing of Rod Rosenstein, and that the president must cooperate with this investigation."
1578,Sanders,3) The Congress must demand that the sanctions against Russia that were passed last year be fully implemented.
1579,Sanders,"2) The Congress must move aggressively to protect our election systems from interference by Russia or any foreign power, and work closely with our democratic partners around the world to do the same."
1580,Sanders,1) The Congress must make it clear that we accept the assessment of our intelligence community with regard to Russian election meddling in our country and in other democracies.
1581,Sanders,"If President Trump won't confront Putin about interference in our elections and his destabilizing policies, Congress must act. Tweets and speeches are fine, but we need more from Republican senators now.Congress must take these 5 actions to rein in Trump's dangerous behavior:"
1582,Sanders,What world is Trump living in? Does he not understand what's going on? Is he being blackmailed because the Russians have compromising information on him? Or is he sympathetic to Putin's style of authoritarianism? Congress must step in and stop Russian meddling in our elections.
1583,Sanders,Yesterday was a good day for Putin and the oligarchs in Russia. But it was a bad day for people in the United States and all over the world who believe in democracy and who are trying to understand what world our idiot president lives in.
1584,Sanders,"ICYMI: Watch the CEOs vs. Workers town hall, aired last night, on the enormous disparity between the wealth of corporate executives and the wages and treatment of workers at companies like Amazon, McDonald's, Disney, Walmart and American Airlines."
1585,Sanders,"I'm glad that Trump has repudiated his absurd statement in Helsinki and now agrees with what our intelligence community has said for over a year. Too bad Trump didn‚Äôt have the guts to say that yesterday while with his authoritarian friend, Vladimir Putin."
1586,Sanders,"The GOP leadership must decide whether Congress will continue being cowardly, obedient followers of the president's absurd policies. Despite battling brain cancer, Sen. John McCain has shown more courage in standing up to Trump than virtually the entire Republican Party combined."

1607,Sanders,Will Jeff Bezos have the guts to face Amazon workers at our town hall tonight at 7 pm ET and explain why he's worth $151 billion but won't pay them a living wage?
1608,Sanders,"How pathetic! Republicans who tell us how much they believe in ""freedom"" and ""national security"" are now caving in to a president who sides with former KGB leader Putin, rather than our own intelligence community."

1614,Sanders,Last year American Airlines made $1.9 billion in profits. Its CEO Doug Parker is on track to make $31 million this year.They need to explain why 27% of workers at their subsidiary Envoy Air said they must accept food stamps and other public assistance to make ends meet.
1615,Sanders,"Universal health care in America is not a radical idea anymore, thanks to the millions who have spoken out to demand a just health care system. 63% of American voters now support a Medicare-for-all health care system."
1616,Sanders,"Walmart‚Äôs CEO Doug McMillon made about $11,000/hour in compensation last year. I'd like to hear from him why he thinks his workers don't deserve to be paid a living wage of $15/hour."
1617,Sanders,The average cashier at McDonald's would have to work for 895 years to make what the company's CEO makes in one year. That is insane.
1618,Sanders,More than 2 out of 3 Disneyland workers say they go hungry. That does not sound like the ‚Äúhappiest place on Earth‚Äù to me.
1619,Sanders,"The Walton family, the owners of Wal-Mart, is the wealthiest family in America. Middle class taxpayers should not have to subsidize Walmart‚Äôs low wages to the tune of at least $6.2 billion each and every year. That's absurd."
1620,Sanders,.@SteveEasterbrk I hope you will come to our town hall on Monday to explain why it's acceptable that you receive a huge compensation package while McDonald's workers struggle to put food on the table. The invitation to our town hall is sincere:
1621,Sanders,"I'd like McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook to explain why the company had enough money to reward its wealthy shareholders with $7.7 billion in stock buybacks, but reneged on a commitment it made to its low-wage workers to pay them at least $1-an-hour above the local minimum wage."
1622,Sanders,"The Trump administration declaring the war on poverty ‚Äúlargely over"" is a callous attempt to justify their efforts to make massive cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security disability, education and affordable housing, while they give huge tax breaks to billionaires."
1623,Sanders,"The billionaires in the Trump administration should tell that to the:- 140 million Americans struggling to pay for basic living expenses- The more than 30 million people who have no health insurance - The seniors trying to live on Social Security benefits of $12,000 a year."

1627,Sanders,"I'm proud to stand with Vermont nurses in their fight for a fair contract that treats them with respect and dignity. At the end of the day, this struggle is about priorities. It‚Äôs about prioritizing patient care over profits."

1633,Sanders,"We spend $700 billion on defense, more than the next 10 nations combined, and end up with 30 million uninsured and crumbling infrastructure. Mr. President, instead of demanding that Europe spend more on planes and guns, why don‚Äôt we join them in guaranteeing health care to all."
1634,Sanders,How would Trump's latest Supreme Court nominee rule on Roe v. Wade? Let candidate Donald Trump give you a hint.
1635,Sanders,I rise to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court:
1636,Sanders,"Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, says he is ""very proud"" of the working conditions at Amazon. Maybe he should listen to the story of this former Amazon worker who, after breaking her foot on the job, was told to take ibuprofen and finish her shift or go home with unpaid time."
1637,Sanders,"I hope the CEOs of Amazon, Disney, McDonald's, Walmart and American Airlines have the guts to sit on a panel with their own employees at our town hall Monday night. Watch live on July 16 at 7 pm EST on my Facebook page. https://t.co/3a3ApIrZh1"
1638,Sanders,Happy #CowAppreciationDay
1639,Sanders,Nothing is more important now than doing everything in our power to stop the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
1640,Sanders,See my full statement here:
1641,Sanders,"President Trump‚Äôs Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will be a rubber-stamp for an extreme, right-wing agenda pushed by corporations and billionaires. We must mobilize the American people to defeat Trump‚Äôs right-wing, reactionary nominee."
1642,Sanders,Bernie responds to Trump‚Äôs Supreme Court pick. Leave your questions for him in the
1643,Sanders,"If Trump appoints another right-wing extremist to the Supreme Court, I have very serious concerns about justice in this country, and what will happen to the people and future of our nation."
1644,Sanders,"If you are serious about this issue, tell your Republican pals in Congress to pass bills requiring Medicare to negotiate drug prices and enabling the importation of safe, low-cost drugs from Canada and other countries. (2/2)"
1645,Sanders,"Stop just talking about high drug prices @realDonaldTrump. Do something. It's not just Pfizer that can raise drug prices ""for no reason."" It's every drug company. In case you didn't know, that's why we have the highest prescription drug prices in the world. (1/2)"
1646,Sanders,Listen to these Patriotic Millionaires: it's patriotic for the very wealthy and corporations to want to pay their fair share in taxes. with @PatrioticMills
1647,Sanders,The Trump administration's slavish devotion to corporate profits and their contempt for the health and well-being of Americans and people throughout the world is beyond appalling.
1648,Sanders,"Let your friends, family and co-workers know. If Trump nominates a right-wing reactionary to the Supreme Court, as is widely expected, we must mobilize the American people to defeat that nomination."
1649,Sanders,"The bottom line is: health care is a right, not a privilege. People should not be forced to live in pain or avoid medical treatment because they lack the funds. We need Medicare for all, and we need it now."
1650,Sanders,"Ed Schultz was a passionate defender of American workers and strongly supported trade policies that work for all, not just large corporations. For many years his voice has been strong, steady &amp; against forces of corporate greed. Ed was a friend of mine and will be sorely missed."
1651,Sanders,I will do everything possible to see that the next EPA administrator actually believes in environmental protection.
1652,Sanders,"Instead of protecting our environment and combating climate change, Pruitt has worked to protect the interests of the fossil fuel industry and polluters all over the country. His resignation is a positive step forward for our country."
1653,Sanders,"Scott Pruitt was the worst EPA administrator in the history of the agency. Not only has he acted, time and time again, in an unethical manner, but he has led the agency in exactly the wrong direction."
1654,Sanders,"The United States must lead the world in transforming our energy system by moving aggressively to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. When we do that, we protect the planet, create jobs and save consumers money."
1655,Sanders,".@realDonaldTrump, climate change is real, very real‚Äîand it is devastating our planet. Stop protecting the interests and short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry, and start worrying about the world future generations will inherit."
1656,Sanders,"We must not be about forcing over 10 million undocumented people, many of whom have been here for decades, to continue living in fear and anxiety. Congress must do what the American people want. Let us create a humane and rational immigration system."
1657,Sanders,"That will mean restructuring the agencies that enforce our immigration laws, including ICE. We must not be about tearing small children away from their families. We must not be about deporting DREAMers, young people who have lived in this country virtually their entire lives."
1658,Sanders,"In 2002 I voted against the creation of DHS and the establishment of ICE. That was the right vote. Now, it is time to do what Americans overwhelmingly want: abolish the cruel, dysfunctional immigration system we have today and pass comprehensive immigration reform."
1659,Sanders,We cannot risk a Supreme Court that would put in jeopardy a woman's right to control her own body.Our job: mobilize Americans to demand the Senate must not vote on any potential Supreme Court justice until people have had a chance to make their voices heard in November.
1660,Sanders,Have you worked a minimum wage fast food job? What is it like to try to support yourself or your family? Do you have access to benefits or career opportunities?
1661,Sanders,It's time to reduce the heavy burden of student debt that is weighing down the lives of millions of former college students and make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
1662,Sanders,"No parent should have to worry about outrageous medical bills while their child is sick. We must pass Medicare for all so that health care is a right for all people in America, not a privilege for a few who can afford it."
1663,Sanders,Thank you to the thousands of people turning out today to protest Trump's cruel policy of separating families. The United States of America must never be about tearing apart families or locking up children in cages. #FamiliesBelongTogether
1664,Sanders,"""This is flirting with fascism in the open, in broad daylight now."" ‚Äì@SanhoTree of Institute for Policy Studies on Trump's demonization of immigrants."
1665,Sanders,There can be no free society without a free media. The work of journalists in this country is absolutely essential to our communities and to a free and functioning democracy. Journalists should never have to fear for their lives as they do their work.
1666,Sanders,"Our thoughts today are with the victims of the horrific shooting at the Capital Gazette yesterday, their families and their colleagues."
1667,Sanders,"I am excited to announce that on July 16 we will hold a live streamed town hall with workers from Amazon, Disney, McDonald‚Äôs and Walmart. I hope their CEOs will have the guts to sit on a panel with their own employees. https://t.co/ci3oa9Bw3N"
1668,Sanders,"When it comes time to decide on a replacement for Justice Kennedy, I hope that my Republican colleagues who believe that women, not the government, have the right to control their bodies will stand with those of us who oppose any nominee who would deny women the right to choose."
1669,Sanders,"We should listen to what Sen. McConnell said in 2016. President Trump should not nominate, and the Senate should not confirm, a Supreme Court justice until the American people have had the opportunity to make their voices heard in November."
1670,Sanders,"The reality is that for many large corporations, wage theft has been an essential part of their business model. That has to change."
1671,Sanders,"While today‚Äôs ruling is a major setback for working families, we must redouble our efforts to make it easier, not harder, to join a union. We cannot rebuild the disappearing middle class without revitalizing the trade union movement."
1672,Sanders,"What the Kochs and other billionaires understand is that if they can destroy the trade union movement in America, it will be even more difficult for workers to earn decent wages and benefits, and the political power of working people will be diminished."
1673,Sanders,"To nobody‚Äôs surprise the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, sided with big money interests and against the needs of working people. Make no mistake about it: this decision is a direct assault on working families all over America."
1674,Sanders,The Trump administration‚Äôs travel ban was never about keeping America safe. We need only look at Trump‚Äôs own words to understand that this has always been a racist and anti-Islamic attempt to ban Muslims from entering this country.
1675,Sanders,Rep. @PeterWelch visited a border patrol ‚Äúprocessing facility‚Äù in Texas holding hundreds of children. Here is what he saw.
1676,Sanders,Right-wing extremists in every state and every branch of government have worked for decades to make it more and more difficult for women to access abortion. We cannot let them win. Abortion is a constitutional right that must be protected.
1677,Sanders,"America loses when we become divided by religion, race, national origin or sexual orientation. We are stronger when we come together."
1678,Sanders,"The Supreme Court sided with fear, racism and xenophobia and against the American ideals of religious freedom and tolerance. Trump's travel ban isn't about keeping America safe. Just look at Trump‚Äôs own words. It's always been a racist attempt to ban Muslims from entering the US."
1679,Sanders,Fox News' coverage of last week's horrific situation of children being separated from their parents at the border was a disgrace.
1680,Sanders,"Never forget that corporations and their executives profit off of the Trump administration's inhumane immigration policies, along with our system of mass incarceration which locks up 2.2 million people in this country."
1681,Sanders,.@RepJayapal visited a federal prison and met with asylum seekers who had been transferred from the border. What they told her is horrifying. We need to fight back against Trump's cruel immigration policy.
1682,Sanders,"Trump's pathological dishonesty is undermining our democracy, setting a terrible example for our children and isolating us from our democratic allies around the world.  Now is the time for the American people to fight back on every front."
1683,Sanders,How has failed U.S. economic policy contributed to families seeking asylum at the border? With @ManuelPerezIPS
1684,Sanders,This child psychiatrist explains the unbelievable trauma inflicted on kids separated from their parents at the border:
1685,Sanders,"Trump tells us every day how much he hates immigrants and how much he loves American workers. But last year, Trump chose to hire only one American worker even though thousands of Americans wanted to work at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The rest were low-wage temporary guest workers."
1686,Sanders,"What a hypocrite! @realDonaldTrump makes hateful and racist rants every day about how immigrants are ‚Äúbad‚Äù for the country, but he had no problem hiring undocumented immigrants to help him build the Trump Hotel in DC or Trump Tower in New York City."
1687,Sanders,"Right now we must strengthen the global coalition of progressive democrats. While authoritarians promote division and hatred, we will promote unity, inclusion, and an agenda based on economic, social, racial and environmental justice."
1688,Sanders,Crystal Mason is facing five years in jail‚Äîfor the crime of voting. (with @ShaunKing)
1689,Sanders,"Trump's strategy of hateful rhetoric and trying to divide the American people up is nothing new. It has been used by authoritarian leaders all over the world. Our job is stand together, fight back, and create the kind of country that we all know we can become."
1690,Sanders,The United States government should use every tool available to lower outrageously high prescription drug prices. It's time to put the pharmaceutical industry on notice that the era of charging unconscionable prices must end.
1691,Sanders,"Six months after Trump and Republicans in Congress passed their tax plan, they are still lying about who it really helps. Here is what's really going on as a result of their scam:"
1692,Sanders,"As it happens, I personally believe that it is totally appropriate for the UN to focus on poverty in the United States ‚Äì the richest county in the history of the world."
1693,Sanders,"Trump's executive order does nothing to ensure the 2,400 kids who have been torn from their parents will be reunited with their families."
1694,Sanders,"Trump's political strategy: 1) Give tax breaks to billionaires, throw millions off health insurance, cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid2) Blame immigrants (or blacks, Muslims, gays, Jews) as the cause of all problemsThis is the kind of hate politics demagogues always use"
1695,Sanders,"Trump thinks he can win votes by showing how tough he is on these little children being separated at the border. Well, that's pretty pathetic and his policies must be defeated."
1696,Sanders,"Because the American people spoke up, Trump has changed his policy of tearing children away from their parents and locking them up in detention cages. But the executive order that he issued today goes nowhere near as far as it should go."
1697,Sanders,"I am hopeful that, as we have seen with other racist and xenophobic Trump policies, the courts will step in to rein in these unlawful actions."
1698,Sanders,"Trump‚Äôs executive order merely replaces one inhumane act with another. In response to the overwhelming public outrage at his policy of tearing children away from their parents at the border, this administration thinks the appropriate response is to indefinitely detain families."
1699,Sanders,Fact check: The Trump administration cannot keep their own story straight about the abhorrent practice of separating families at the border. Here is the truth about what's happening.
1700,Sanders,"When you have the most powerful nation on earth saying that it is acceptable to tear children from the arms of their parents, you are sending a signal to countries around the world that this is how they can treat immigrants and minorities. That is a very dangerous signal."
1701,Sanders,"To be politically successful, Trump needs to create enemies and divide us up. He needs to turn men against women, white against black, straight against the LGBT community, Christian against Muslim, native born against immigrant. We will not let him win."
1702,Sanders,"The Acting Director of ICE can't bring himself to say that separating families is humane, yet he insists on continuing this horrifying policy."
1703,Sanders,"Since 1990, 4 defense contractors (including Lockheed &amp; Boeing) spent over $714 million on lobbying and campaign contributions. Yesterday, their wish for endless war was granted while children in America go hungry and veterans sleep on the street."
1704,Sanders,"""We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view."" ‚Äì @RepCummings"
1705,Sanders,"What is happening at the border right now constitutes torture, according to @amnesty. Separating parents from their children is inhumane and must be stopped."
1706,Sanders,We cannot spend more on our military than the next 10 nations combined while millions of Americans do not have food and housing and health care. It‚Äôs about time we got our national priorities right. That is why I voted against spending $716 billion on the military today.
1707,Sanders,The United States of America is not and must never be about locking up little children in cages on the southern border.
1708,Sanders,"BREAKING: The U.S. government released horrifying footage of a child detention center in Texas. Together, we must defeat this inhumane and un-American action."
1709,Sanders,"Apply now for paid fall internships in Sen. Sanders' Washington D.C., Burlington and St. Johnsbury offices. The deadline to apply is this Friday, June 22."
1710,Sanders,"""We must move from considering others as threats to our comfort to valuing them as persons whose life experience and values can contribute greatly to the enrichment of our society."" ‚ÄìPope"
1711,Sanders,This nun has a message for the members of the Trump administration who are using the Bible to justify ripping immigrant children away from their parents.
1712,Sanders,I say to Disney CEO Bob Iger: you can lead this country in ending the type of corporate greed which is causing so much pain. Start paying all of your workers a livable wage with decent benefits.
1713,Sanders,"Together, we will defeat the Trump administration's inhumane and un-American policy of ripping babies from the arms of their mothers and fathers."
1714,Sanders,.@SenMikeLee and I call on Sec. Mattis to immediately disclose the full extent of the U.S. military role in the Saudi-led war against Yemen‚Äôs Houthis and issue a public declaration opposing the impending assault on Hodeida.
1715,Sanders,"This is America, a nation of compassion and generosity. We will not allow Trump, Sessions or anyone else to continue a policy of ripping babies from the arms of their mothers. Together, we will defeat this inhumane and un-American action."
1716,Sanders,"The Trump admin, in its unabashed cruelty, is carving out a unique place in American history. It's not just support for racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia and religious bigotry. They've hit a new low by separating kids from their parents and placing them in detention centers."
1717,Sanders,The U.S. must stop its unconstitutional and unauthorized participation in this war and support the UN‚Äôs effort to get a cease-fire. No child should have to live like this.
1718,Sanders,President Trump's effusive remarks about Kim Jong Un are just the latest example of his very troubling affinity for authoritarians.
1719,Sanders,"For whatever reason‚Äîyou got me, I don't know why‚ÄîTrump and his administration want to make a bad situation even worse when it comes to health care in this country."
1720,Sanders,Se estima que los transportistas portuarios son timados por un monto de $850 millones cada a√±o.
1721,Sanders,It's a simple question: Should we listen to the majority of the American people who say they oppose spending more money on the military or should we listen to the lobbyists from the military industrial complex?
1722,Sanders,"This is what oligarchy looks like. This is what greed is doing to our country.Amazon (whose CEO, Jeff Bezos, is the richest person in the world) used its enormous power to kill a modest tax designed to address the affordable housing crisis in"
1723,Sanders,"The Trump administration‚Äôs ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy of separating children, including infants as young as one year old, from their parents at the border is inhumane, cruel and an affront to our values as Americans."
1724,Sanders,"It's already hurricane season and about 11,000 people in Puerto Rico still don't have power. We cannot leave them behind to face even more destruction."
1725,Sanders,"To afford a two-bedroom apartment, a worker making the federal minimum wage would need to work 122 hours a week. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage and that has got to change."
1726,Sanders,"This merger represents a gross concentration of power that runs counter to the public good. At a time when our telecommunications and media industries are already too concentrated, we should be focused on opening those markets to more competition, not less."
1727,Sanders,Why does Trump's health secretary care more about protecting the profits of the drug industry than the lives of Americans who can‚Äôt afford the highest prescription drug prices in the world?
1728,Sanders,"Two years after 49 people were killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, it is a national tragedy that we have not done a single thing to prevent another mass shooting. We must pass gun safety legislation now. My thoughts are with those who are remembering their loved ones today."
1729,Sanders,No married couple in America should have to choose between divorce or bankruptcy to afford health care. We must pass Medicare for All.
1730,Sanders,Port truck drivers are cheated out of an estimated $850 million a year. They're driving for 20 hours a day and taking home paychecks worth nothing. They are denied health care and overtime pay. This is modern-day slavery.
1731,Sanders,"While very light on substance, Trump and Kim Jong Un's meeting is a positive step in de-escalating tensions and addressing the threat of North Korea‚Äôs nuclear weapons. Congress has a key role to play in making sure this is a meaningful process, not just a series of photo ops."
1732,Sanders,"Apply for paid fall internships in Sen. Sanders' Washington D.C., Burlington and St. Johnsbury offices. The deadline to apply is June 22."
1733,Sanders,"Since 1995, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and United Technologies have paid nearly $3 billion in fines or related settlements for fraud or misconduct. Yet, those three companies alone received about $800 billion in defense contracts over the past 18 years."
1734,Sanders,"Over and over again, Republicans say we cannot possibly afford to make health care a right through a Medicare-for-all program.But when it comes to spending $716 billion on the military, all of a sudden there's deafening silence from my Republican colleagues about the deficit."
1735,Sanders,"It‚Äôs about time we got our national priorities right. I believe in a strong national defense, but we cannot continue to give the Pentagon and defense contractors a blank check while we ignore the basic needs of working families."
1736,Sanders,"We have a racist criminal justice system that costs us billions of dollars, ruins lives and allows private prisons to profit off of human misery. It's time for real criminal justice reform."
1737,Sanders,"I find it very strange that President Trump has such a hard time getting along with the leaders of the world's major democracies, but feels very comfortable with despots and authoritarian leaders."
1738,Sanders,"It's a travesty that the Supreme Court upheld Ohio‚Äôs voter suppression efforts. Instead of making people jump through hoops to vote, states should pass automatic voter registration and same-day registration. Politicians afraid of large voter turnouts are political cowards."
1739,Sanders,"Pope Francis is right. We must reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and transform our energy system to renewable energy. If we do not, the consequences will be"
1740,Sanders,"Obamacare made it illegal for insurance companies to refuse coverage to the more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. If Trump gets his way, that protection will be repealed."
1741,Sanders,"I find it very strange that President Trump has such a hard time getting along with the leaders of the world's major democracies but feels very comfortable with despots and authoritarian leaders like Putin, Xi Jinping, Duterte and Mohammad Bin Salman."
1742,Sanders,"We are dealing with a crisis of inequality and that is why we must start making the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes, not give breaks to those at the top. with @keithellison"
1743,Sanders,Privatizing the VA would be an insult to the more than 22 million veterans who risked their lives to defend our country.
1744,Sanders,More than 2 out of 3 Disneyland workers say they go hungry. That does not sound like the ‚Äúhappiest place on Earth‚Äù to me.
1745,Sanders,"In their never-ending quest to throw millions off health insurance and raise premiums, the Trump Administration is now arguing in court that it should be legal for insurance companies to discriminate against the 130 million people with pre-existing conditions. That is a disgrace."
1746,Sanders,"Employee-owned companies won't provide starvation wages to workers and huge compensation packages to CEOs. They will not shut down and send their own jobs to China. In fact, study after study has shown that employee ownership increases employment, sales and wages."
1747,Sanders,"Instead of giving huge tax breaks to corporations who shut down in the United States and send jobs abroad to low-wage countries, we must invest in creating worker-owned companies."
1748,Sanders,A billionaire shouldn't have any more of a right to run for office than a working stiff who can't afford to raise the millions of dollars needed for a campaign.
1749,Sanders,"Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst @Judgenap agrees with me: It is Congress' responsibility to decide when to put our young men and women in harm's way, not the president."
1750,Sanders,"Disney's CEO said the company had a ""great quarter."" Disneyland employees who can't afford rent or food beg to differ."
1751,Sanders,"We all hope that the summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un is successful. Getting rid of North Korea's nuclear weapons through a credible process would be a major step forward for world peace. But when Trump praises Kim as ‚Äúvery honorable,‚Äù he makes a mockery of American values."
1752,Sanders,"Trump's war on the poor continues. First he wants to throw millions off nutrition assistance and Medicaid, and now he's going after affordable housing. Trump's agenda is simple: tax breaks for the rich, devastating cuts for the poor. We must fight back and create a moral economy."
1753,Sanders,"Rusty Williams says medical cannabis helped him get through chemotherapy and saved his life. We should be allowing states to move forward with legalization efforts, not interfering with the great progress that has been made."
1754,Sanders,I believe that we have become far too comfortable with the United States engaging in military interventions all over the world. We need to ask this very hard question: is a perpetual war necessary to keep us safe?
1755,Sanders,"Disney makes $9 billion in profits, gives its CEO over $400 million and yet Disneyland workers can't afford to put a roof over their heads."
1756,Sanders,"The reality is that Disney‚Äôs greed, and the greed of corporate America, is destroying the social fabric of our country. This type of ruthless capitalism is not an economic model that we should be embracing. We can and we must do better."
1757,Sanders,The voices of the Palestinians are rarely heard. This is what life is like for those who are living in Gaza under a 10 year blockade:
1758,Sanders,Never-ending wars must end. Join me and @RandPaul for a hearing to investigate the impact and the constitutional implications of open-ended
1759,Sanders,"If we were a poor country, it would be reasonable to question whether we can achieve universal health care.But we are not. We're the richest country in the history of the world. We can and must make health care a right to all."
1760,Sanders,What is the moral defense of a company like Disney that makes $9 billion in profits and pays a 30-year employee so little that she goes hungry?
1761,Sanders,We have to decide as a nation whether information about what we do with our lives should be sold to companies that will exploit that information.
1762,Sanders,"It costs $30,000 to send a California student to UCLA for a year. To send someone to prison, it costs $75,000.We need to be a nation that invests in jobs and education, not jails and incarceration."
1763,Sanders,This is not what Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse are supposed to be about. Disney must pay all of its workers a living wage.
1764,Sanders,"I want to hear the moral defense of a company like Disney that makes $9 billion in profits, $400 million for their CEO and has a 30-year worker going hungry."
1765,Sanders,Over the next decade we will spend nearly $1 trillion jailing our fellow citizens. Imagine what we could accomplish if we reduced that number by 10 or 20 percent?
1766,Sanders,"In 2018, in the United States of America, we have have workers who are treated like indentured servants. That is a disgrace. We must stand with port truck drivers who are fighting for justice."
1767,Sanders,"This is what a rigged economy looks like: Working 100 hours in a week, not getting paid and actually owing the company a check.Port truck drivers in this country deserve justice!"
1768,Sanders,"Truck drivers deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, not like modern-day indentured servants. That is what we are here in California today to demand."
1769,Sanders,"We are joining Disneyland workers today to say: If Disney can afford to pay its CEO up to $423 million, it can afford to pay all of its workers a living wage."
1770,Sanders,"I strongly support imposing penalties on countries like China, Russia, South Korea and Vietnam to stop illegal dumping of steel and aluminum. But it makes no sense to start a trade war with Canada, the EU and others who are engaged in fair trade and pay workers a living wage."
1771,Sanders,"Trump‚Äôs haphazard and reckless plan to impose tariffs on Canada and the European Union is an absolute disaster that will cause unnecessary economic pain to farmers, manufacturers and consumers in Vermont and around the country."
1772,Sanders,I have a feeling ABC will not be asking on its nightly news program tonight how Disney can make $9 billion in profits while three-quarters of Disneyland employees can‚Äôt afford basic living expenses.
1773,Sanders,Even Fox News is fed up with Trump's pathetic and evidence-free conspiracy theories.
1774,Sanders,"We cannot forget that the people of Puerto Rico, who are American citizens, are still suffering from the devastation of Hurricane Maria and need our help."
1775,Sanders,You want to talk about what it means to be anti-wealth? Jeff Bezos capturing $133 billion in wealth while paying his workers starvation wages for backbreaking work is anti-wealth.
1776,Sanders,"Memorial Day is a time to pay special tribute to service members who paid the ultimate sacrifice and to honor and support their families. We should be united in commemorating the sacrifices of those who gave, as Lincoln said, ‚Äúthe last full measure of devotion‚Äù to our country."
1777,Sanders,"Our job: Increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour, create up to 15 million good jobs rebuilding America, expand Social Security, enact Medicare for all, and make it easier for workers to join unions."
1778,Sanders,"When Trump tells us the economy is ""booming,"" please remember:- Over 40% of Americans don't have enough savings to cover a $400 emergency expense- 43% can't afford the basics to live- Over 25% of adults skipped necessary medical care last year because they couldn't afford it"
1779,Sanders,"Instead of spending $20 billion to raise the minimum wage at Walmart to $16.66 an hour, Walmart is putting more money in the pockets of their wealthy shareholders. This is what corporate greed looks like."
1780,Sanders,I have serious concerns when you have a president of the United States who is constantly trying to undermine democratic institutions. That is wrong and together we must fight back.
1781,Sanders,"If Finland and other Nordic countries can make child care affordable and accessible to all, the United States should be able to as well."
1782,Sanders,"With the apparent cancellation of the summit, the Trump administration should now commit itself to working with our allies in Asia and the international community on a genuine diplomatic strategy to remove the threat of North Korea‚Äôs nuclear weapons."
1783,Sanders,"From the beginning, when Trump impulsively decided that he would meet with Kim Jong Un, it has been clear that the summit involved very little preparation. The threat of North Korea‚Äôs nuclear program is a very serious issue that requires serious diplomacy."
1784,Sanders,President Trump: you are not improving health care when you deny funding to Planned Parenthood and deny millions of women their provider of health care. Stop the attack on women's health.
1785,Sanders,"At a time when banks have never been more profitable, Congress voted yesterday to give them another massive gift in the form of deregulation. Our job is to break up the largest financial institutions in the country, not reward their greed and recklessness."
1786,Sanders,"I am concerned that despite some very good provisions in the VA MISSION Act, it continues a trend toward the slow, steady privatization of the VA. I will vote against it."
1787,Sanders,"How sad is it that we now have students in this country who are expecting violence in their schools. As Congresswoman @RosaDelauro says, the Congress must stand up to the NRA and pass gun safety legislation. Enough is enough."
1788,Sanders,"At a time of exploding profits, I would hope that @Amazon would pay everyone who works in your fulfillment centers a living wage. Thank you very much for your invitation to visit a fulfillment center. I look forward to doing that. Let‚Äôs work out a mutually convenient time."
1789,Sanders,"Thank you @amazonnews for your response to our video. I remain deeply concerned about Amazon, an enormously profitable corporation, paying workers wages that are so low that they are forced to depend on federal programs like Medicaid, food stamps and public housing for survival."
1790,Sanders,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' wealth increases by $275 million every single day. Meanwhile, Amazon workers have to rely on food stamps and public assistance just to survive. This is what a rigged economy is all about."
1791,Sanders,There's a three-letter word stopping us from passing common sense gun safety legislation: NRA.
1792,Sanders,"In Vermont, Planned Parenthood is the only provider of Title X services, and without federal funding, their ability to serve thousands of low-income Vermonters will be seriously limited."
1793,Sanders,"I always find it curious that ""conservatives"" tell us how much they want to get the government off the backs of the people. But when it comes to women and family planning, they want to the government to tell every woman in America what she can and cannot do with her body."
1794,Sanders,This is the latest disgraceful attack on women‚Äôs rights by the Trump administration. Title X funds provide much-needed family planning services for millions of people around this country.
1795,Sanders,"The American people, gun owners and non-gun owners alike, overwhelmingly support common sense gun safety legislation. It's time to act."
1796,Sanders,There's little left to be said about the horrific school shooting tragedies that we've seen over and over ‚Äì today in Texas. These are very sick acts. Congress and Trump must finally have the courage to stand up to the NRA and do what the American people want. Enough is enough!
1797,Sanders,"The three wealthiest people in America own more wealth than the bottom 50 percent ‚Äî over 160 million people. Meanwhile, almost half of families in America can't afford basic necessities. Is that really the kind of society we want to be living in?"
1798,Sanders,It is not a radical idea to say that every American citizen over the age of 18 should be automatically registered to vote.
1799,Sanders,"We are dealing with a crisis of inequality and that is why we must start making the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes, not give more breaks to those at the top."
1800,Sanders,The United States Senate just voted to repeal the disastrous FCC decision to end #NetNeutrality. We must demand that the House does the right thing and stands with the Senate to overturn this decision.
1801,Sanders,"Congratulations, President Trump, on being the first president in history whose speech on ""bringing down drug prices"" sent pharma stocks soaring."
1802,Sanders,The Senate just took an important step toward reversing the Trump administration‚Äôs disastrous decision to repeal #NetNeutrality. Now the House must side with the 86% of Americans who support net neutrality and pass this resolution to protect our free speech and democracy.
1803,Sanders,"Millions of people are given excessive parole, probation or sentences, whose lives are destroyed while taxpayers pay millions to lock people up. If we are going to address mass incarceration that has got to change."
1804,Sanders,"Up to 20% of incarcerated people in America are imprisoned because they lack the money to pay cash bail or fines for minor violations. Let me say that again. Some 400,000 people are incarcerated today for crimes they haven't been convicted of. That is insane."
1805,Sanders,Nearly 40 percent of rural Americans lack high speed broadband. Repealing #NetNeutrality would make a bad situation worse for rural America. with @ilsr
1806,Sanders,"The repeal of #NetNeutrality hands the internet over to a handful of corporations while people of color, low-income families, disabled communities and rural towns get pushed offline. with @mediajustice"
1807,Sanders,"We're not a free society without a free and open internet. Without #NetNeutrality, our democracy could be in trouble. with @demandprogress"
1808,Sanders,The Senate votes today on whether to overturn the FCC‚Äôs #NetNeutrality ruling. There‚Äôs never been a more important vote in the Senate for the future of the internet. with @freepress
1809,Sanders,We need to stop imprisoning people for smoking marijuana and start prosecuting the crooks on Wall Street whose greed and illegal behavior caused the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression.
1810,Sanders,"For the sake of Israelis and Palestinians alike, the United States must act urgently to help relieve the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip."
1811,Sanders,"In light of yesterday‚Äôs horrific violence in Gaza, in which more than 50 Palestinians were killed and more than 2000 wounded by Israeli snipers, it‚Äôs important to understand the desperate situation out of which these protests have arisen."
1812,Sanders,"Do Facebook, Amazon, Google and other tech giants pose a threat to American democracy? Join us for a discussion of that question and more with @linamkhan and @sarahmillerdc of the Open Markets"
1813,Sanders,I do believe that in their heart of hearts the American people want to see their government play a constructive role around the world and bring people together. #BernieTownHall
1814,Sanders,"""This is not America first. This is America alone."" ‚Äì@SuzanneDiMaggio #BernieTownHall"
1815,Sanders,The Constitution is very clear that it is Congress and not the president who has war-making powers. Congress has abdicated that responsibility for a very long time. #BernieTownHall
1816,Sanders,"""American policy in the Middle East is in free fall."" ‚Äì@Cirincione #BernieTownHall"
1817,Sanders,"""There are people who welcome a breakdown of this agreement and welcome getting back the possibility of regime change."" ‚Äì@LaraFriedmanDC #BernieTownHall"
1818,Sanders,"""What Trump has done is one step toward losing the hearts and minds of the Iranian people."" -@SuzanneDiMaggio #BernieTownHall"
1819,Sanders,"""Trump has stoked the fire in the Middle East rather than calm it."" ‚Äì@SuzanneDiMaggio #BernieTownHall"
1820,Sanders,"""President Trump's decision to violate the [Iran nuclear] agreement was by far the most destructive act of his presidency."" -@Cirincione #BernieTownHall"
1821,Sanders,"If you are concerned about education, infrastructure and health care, then you should be concerned about foreign policy. #BernieTownHall"
1822,Sanders,LIVE TOWN HALL: Has Trump put America on the path to war by pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal? Join our town hall now as we discuss that question and more with a panel of experts. #BernieTownHall
1823,Sanders,"Tonight, along with a great panel, I will discuss alternatives to the hawkish Washington foreign policy establishment that remains committed to never-ending military interventions. Tune in at 7PM ET. https://t.co/q6wwJwsfAg"
1824,Sanders,John Bolton really has chutzpah. First Bolton urges George W. Bush to invade Iraq and now he is moving our country closer to conflict with Iran. We are on a very dangerous path.
1825,Sanders,"You can‚Äôt make this stuff up. Trump promised over and over again that he would bring back American jobs that have been outsourced to China. Instead of working to bring back outsourced jobs, he is now pledging to help create jobs in China."
1826,Sanders,"The United States must play an aggressive role in bringing Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt and the international community together to address Gaza‚Äôs humanitarian crisis and stop this escalating violence."
1827,Sanders,"Over 50 killed in Gaza today and 2,000 wounded, on top of the 41 killed and more than 9,000 wounded over the past weeks. This is a staggering toll. Hamas violence does not justify Israel firing on unarmed protesters."
1828,Sanders,Watch the town hall on Trump's decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal live here at 7 pm ET:
1829,Sanders,"By ending the nuclear deal, has Trump put America on the path to war? Join us to discuss that question and more tonight at 7 pm ET."
1830,Sanders,TOWN HALL TONIGHT: Do you have a question you want to ask the panel at tonight's town hall on Trump's decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal? Leave a response below.https://t.co/q6wwJwsfAg
1831,Sanders,Happy Mother's Day to Jane and all the mothers of this country.
1832,Sanders,"30,000 Toys ""R"" Us workers across the country are losing their jobs. This is what happens when you have a system that allows private equity firms to destroy profitable businesses and throw workers out on the streets with no severance."
1833,Sanders,"MONDAY NIGHT: Our next livestreamed town hall, this time on the Iran nuclear deal. Tune in at 7 ET: https://t.co/q6wwJwsfAg"
1834,Sanders,"If we're going to reverse the 40-year decline of the middle class and reduce the widening gap between the super-rich and everyone else, we must restore the constitutional right of workers to collectively bargain for a better life."
1835,Sanders,"Unlike Trump, Congress¬†must take real action to lower the price of prescription drugs. That means passing legislation requiring Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices and allowing the reimportation of safe, low-cost prescription drugs from Canada and other countries."
1836,Sanders,"The president made clear today that he will not keep the promises he made during the campaign to lower the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs. Instead, he has become a supporter of the pharmaceutical industry's extraordinary greed."
1837,Sanders,Shock of all shocks: It turns out that President Trump was not being honest when he said he was going to stop the prescription drug companies from ‚Äúgetting away with murder.‚Äù Another day. Another lie.
1838,Sanders,This is insane. In the United States of America as many as 20% of people incarcerated are behind bars for the crime of being poor. (Featuring @ShaunKing)
1839,Sanders,Americans are forced to pay the highest prices in the world for the medicine they need as a result of the incredible wealth and political power of the pharmaceutical industry. That is not acceptable.
1840,Sanders,Our next town hall on Monday night will address the consequences of President Trump pulling the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal. Tune in on Facebook Live: https://t.co/q6wwJwsfAg
1841,Sanders,"Democracy means one person, one vote. It does not mean billionaires like Sheldon Adelson buying elections. Our job:-Overturn Citizens United-Move toward public funding of elections-End voter"
1842,Sanders,We need a new CIA director who is committed to the rule of law and will heed the advice of U.S. military leaders who vigorously oppose torture and uphold the values that have made us a great and respected nation. Ms. Haspel is the wrong choice to lead the CIA.
1843,Sanders,The end of net neutrality would be a disaster for our country and the free flow of ideas. But this fight is not over. Here's what's at stake and how we can save net neutrality:
1844,Sanders,"On Monday night, I'll be joined by regional, security and nonproliferation experts for a live town hall on the consequences of Trump‚Äôs decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear agreement. Tune in: https://t.co/q6wwJwsfAg"
1845,Sanders,"In America today, if an employee is engaged in a union organizing campaign, that employee has a one in five chance of getting fired. That is unacceptable and that has got to change."
1846,Sanders,Perhaps the most significant reason for the 40-year decline in the middle class is the decline of trade unionism in America.
1847,Sanders,"We cannot live in an economy where we do what is only good for the employer. It‚Äôs about time that we start looking at the needs of workers, and not just large corporations."
1848,Sanders,"The end of #NetNeutrality would be a disaster for our country, for small businesses and for the free flow of ideas. My colleagues and I are forcing a vote to overturn the FCC's decision to repeal net neutrality. This fight is not over."
1849,Sanders,"Join me, @repmarkpocan, our colleagues and union leaders as we introduce the Workplace Democracy Act, which would strengthen the middle class by restoring workers' rights to bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions."
1850,Sanders,"If we're serious about reducing income inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we must increase the number of union jobs in this country."
1851,Sanders,We need to understand the cost of Trump's move to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal. Watch my foreign policy advisor break down this reckless decision:
1852,Sanders,"Real American power is not shown by our ability to blow things up, but by our ability to forge international consensus around shared problems. That is what the Iran agreement did.Today President Trump put us on a very different, more dangerous path."
1853,Sanders,President Trump‚Äôs decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal is the latest in a series of reckless decisions that move our country closer to conflict.
1854,Sanders,Watch my response to Trump‚Äôs decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.
1855,Sanders,
1856,Sanders,I will deliver a response to President Trump's announcement on the Iran nuclear deal today at 3 PM ET. Watch live at https://t.co/2UhhD5ROch
1857,Sanders,"Last week in Philadelphia I joined @Krasner4DA, @KeeangaYamahtta, @premaldharia and @DanielDenvir to address the crisis of mass incarceration and how we can achieve real criminal justice reform. Listen here:"
1858,Sanders,"Donald Trump has lied more than 3,000 times since taking office but Republicans refuse to say Trump is a liar. What's going on?"
1859,Sanders,It's time for Democrat and Republican leaders to recognize that a progressive agenda isn't radical. It's what the majority of American voters support. @DataProgress
1860,Sanders,"We should have the best educated population on Earth, not the most incarcerated population."
1861,Sanders,"It‚Äôs important that we reject abstinence-only education and support what the American people want: sex education in our schools that provides young people with accurate, comprehensive information about sex that will make them safer."
1862,Sanders,Watch here: https://t.co/HOMobHJjam
1863,Sanders,"LIVE NOW: Join a discussion on criminal justice reform live from Philadelphia with Sen. Sanders, Larry Krasner, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, Premal Dharia and Daniel Denvir."
1864,Sanders,"Congratulations to the teachers of Arizona - and West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Colorado. You have shown us what happens when working people stand together."
1865,Sanders,TODAY at 2:30 ET: Join a discussion on criminal justice reform live from Philadelphia at https://t.co/TIdQMUk3ML.
1866,Sanders,"Remember when Trump said Big Pharma was ""getting away with murder""? Well Mr. President, you don't take on pharma by giving them massive tax breaks."
1867,Sanders,The United States incarcerates 2.2 million people and disproportionately incarcerates people of color. That has got to be addressed. Tune in tomorrow at 2:30 ET at https://t.co/TIdQMUk3ML for a discussion on criminal justice reform live from Philadelphia.
1868,Sanders,I have strong concerns that the Trump administration is getting the U.S. more involved in a war in Yemen without congressional authorization. I'll be seeking further clarification on these activities. We must prevent the U.S. from getting dragged into another never-ending war.
1869,Sanders,Amazon is using its enormous power to dissuade the city of Seattle from passing a modest tax on profitable corporations to address their severe housing crisis. This is what corporate power and oligarchy is all about.
1870,Sanders,"For far too long, the United States health care system has put corporate profits over people's lives. That disgrace has got to end. #MedicareForAll"
1871,Sanders,This is pathetic. We should not be seeing 4 million Americans lose their health insurance. We should be guaranteeing health care for everyone through a Medicare for All program.
1872,Sanders,"If Mylan thinks health care should be a right, it might want to reconsider some of its practices like quadrupling the price of EpiPen while giving its CEO a 671% raise."
1873,Sanders,"Unbelievably, hundreds of thousands of low-income Americans are in jail because they can't afford cash bail, or are unable to pay fines owed to local governments. We should be attempting to alleviate poverty, not jailing people because they are poor."
1874,Sanders,"What Nemiah is doing is admirable, but an 11-year-old should not have to raise money to keep her mother alive in the wealthiest country in the world. Health care must be a right. #MedicareForAll"
1875,Sanders,I stand with the thousands of Puerto Ricans protesting the latest austerity measures. We must stop treating Puerto Rico like a colony and start treating the people of Puerto Rico as the fellow American citizens that they are.
1876,Sanders,"Every day we must strive for a just and moral economy with decent wages, decent benefits and decent working conditions for all workers. That is a struggle that must be carried on by every generation. #MayDay"
1877,Sanders,You know what Amazon paid in federal income taxes last year?Zero.
1878,Sanders,Trump's tax bill was a scam from the very beginning. We have got to hold Republican leaders accountable for deceiving the American people and giving massive tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations.
1879,Sanders,We are finally beginning to see some major victories in reforming our broken criminal justice system which has destroyed so many lives.
1880,Sanders,"Congratulations to teachers for leading this country forward. A nation which doesn‚Äôt educate its children properly will fail. Instead of spending billions on jails and incarceration, we must invest in our teachers and schools."
1881,Sanders,"Phil Hoff was one of the great governors in Vermont history and a leading progressive of his era. History will remember him as a man of great courage who not only helped transform Vermont but was years ahead of his time in the fight for economic, social and racial justice."
1882,Sanders,We have a crisis of public education funding in this country. Twenty-nine states gave less money to schools in 2015 than they did before the recession. That is outrageous. @IPS_DC
1883,Sanders,"Take a look at what Finland, the happiest country in the world, is doing. If Finland can provide everyone with health care, send everyone to college for free and provide affordable child care, why can't the US? (featuring @anupartanen)"
1884,Sanders,"Thousands of teachers in a so-called ""red state"" are marching to demand support for our kids over more handouts to billionaires. That is what real change looks like."
1885,Sanders,"And we need a secretary of state who will address the crisis of climate change, not stymie action on one of the world‚Äôs most serious security threats. For all these reasons, Mike Pompeo is absolutely the wrong choice to serve as the United States‚Äô top diplomat"
1886,Sanders,"We need a secretary of state who will stand up for people of all faiths, sexual orientations and genders, not someone like Pompeo who opposes women‚Äôs rights and LGBTQ rights and who promotes religious bigotry."
1887,Sanders,"I voted against Pompeo because we need a secretary of state who'll check Trump‚Äôs bellicose nature, not encourage it. After 15+ years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, we need someone who will bring nations together in diplomatic efforts, not someone who supports never-ending wars."
1888,Sanders,"Have you been ripped off, bankrupted, or denied coverage by your insurer? Share your story with Bernie."
1889,Sanders,"Our job is to strengthen the VA in order to provide high-quality care to our veterans, not dismantle it."
1890,Sanders,"I hope that Trump will submit a new nominee who has the experience necessary to run the agency, who sides with every major veterans‚Äô organization in vigorously opposing VA privatization and who will work to quickly fill the vacancies so our veterans get the care they deserve."
1891,Sanders,The Trump tax cuts are rewarding Wells Fargo‚Äîthe bank that defrauded millions of customers last year‚Äîwith $3.7 billion. How does that make sense?
1892,Sanders,‚ö°Ô∏è ‚ÄúBernie wants to imprison Big Pharma executives‚Äù by
1893,Sanders,The average cashier at McDonald's would have to work for 895 years to earn what the CEO makes in a year. Corporate greed has got to end. No more paying workers starvation wages.
1894,Sanders,Big surprise. It turns out a lot of Trump's talk about his tax cuts is a lie. Here are some of his most egregious claims:
1895,Sanders,"Mick Mulvaney tells us everything we need to know about how Washington works, and why wealthy special interests make billions in campaign contributions. Government should be about representing ordinary Americans, not just the rich and the powerful."
1896,Sanders,This is a story that should be on CNN. This is the real impact of the Trump administration on families in America.
1897,Sanders,"Delivery of royal baby: $8,900Regular hospital birth in America: $10,808#MedicareForAll"
1898,Sanders,The time is long overdue for us to remove the absurd federal prohibition on marijuana.
1899,Sanders,Want to understand why workers around the country are standing up and fighting back? Take a look at what JetBlue flight attendants did by joining the Transport Workers Union @transportworker
1900,Sanders,"On this #EarthDay let's commit to build a sustainable energy future and a healthy, livable planet for all of our kids and grandchildren. That is our moral responsibility."
1901,Sanders,The situation in Gaza is a humanitarian crisis. The United States must play a more aggressive and even-handed role in ending the Gaza blockade and helping Palestinians and Israelis build a future that works for all.
1902,Sanders,Congratulations to the students who are standing up and speaking out today in the #NationalSchoolWalkout. Your leadership will move us forward. It's long past time for Congress to take action on gun safety to save innocent lives.
1903,Sanders,Now is the time to remove the ridiculous federal prohibition on marijuana. I'm proud to co-sponsor the Marijuana Justice Act.
1904,Sanders,"Join me and Rev. William Barber II live from Duke University for a conversation on the enduring challenge of a moral economy, 50 years after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. challenged racism, poverty, and militarism."
1905,Sanders,We are spending $80 billion locking people up. Think about what it would mean if we invested that money in our people instead of more jails.
1906,Sanders,Join me and @CoryBooker as we talk about ending the federal prohibition on marijuana.
1907,Sanders,It's time to hold opioid manufacturers and their executives accountable for the crisis they have created.
1908,Sanders,Thanks to @iamcardib for calling attention to the importance of Social Security.
1909,Sanders,"We are the wealthiest country in the world. Our full resources must be brought to fix not just this blackout, but the ongoing outages that have left hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans without power since Hurricane"
1910,Sanders,Cardi B is right. If we are really going to make America great we need to strengthen Social Security so that seniors are able to retire with the dignity they deserve.
1911,Sanders,"Barbara Bush will be remembered as a strong, independently minded and popular First Lady who was devoted to her family and her country. Jane and I send our condolences to the Bush family."
1912,Sanders,"The Walton family of Walmart is worth over $160 billion, but low-wage Walmart workers are struggling to get by. Do you think the Waltons have enough money to pay their workers a living wage?"
1913,Sanders,Today on #TaxDay Americans around the country are standing up against a Republican tax plan that looks out for the ultra-wealthy while leaving working families behind.
1914,Sanders,We have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax dodging for large corporations. It's time to repeal the Trump tax breaks for the wealthy and large corporations and rebuild the disappearing middle class. #TaxDay
1915,Sanders,"Congratulations to the JetBlue crew members who overwhelmingly voted to join the Transportation Workers Union. This is a significant victory for JetBlue workers, for the labor movement and for our country."
1916,Sanders,Today I'm introducing legislation to hold the pharmaceutical companies and executives that created the opioid crisis accountable for the extraordinary harm they have caused.
1917,Sanders,"While some drug companies have made billions each year in profits, not one of them has been held fully accountable for its role in an epidemic that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. That has got to change."
1918,Sanders,"If Disney can afford to lavish its CEO with over $100 million, it can and it must pay all of its workers a living wage."
1919,Sanders,"Too often, our foreign policy debate here in Washington is dominated by those whose answer to complicated international situations seems always to involve dropping more bombs, rather than engage in the hard work of diplomacy and negotiation. https://t.co/DVExEnLXBE"
1920,Sanders,"Poverty is one of the great moral issues of our time. On Thursday night, at Duke University, I look forward to discussing with Rev. William Barber how we can best address the poverty crisis in the United States."
1921,Sanders,"It is Congress, not the president, which has the constitutional responsibility for making war. The international community must uphold the prohibition against the use of chemical weapons, but it is unclear how Trump's illegal and unauthorized strikes on Syria achieve that goal."
1922,Sanders,"""Did you see that video of all the TV news anchors reading from the same script about fake news? Maybe you asked yourself: What is happening to local news? The answer is Sinclair."" -@notaaroncraig"
1923,Sanders,"One of my great fears is that President Trump, through a combination of arrogance, ignorance and incompetence, will get the United States into another war."
1924,Sanders,"If the Postal Service is going to be a vibrant entity, we must end this Bush-era mandate. We must also allow the Postal Service to raise new revenue by offering innovative new services that the American people need, including basic banking services."
1925,Sanders,The main reason for the financial problems at the Postal Service stems from a 2006 mandate forcing it to pre-fund 75-years of retiree health benefits to employees who haven‚Äôt been born yet. No other business or government agency is burdened with such an absurd requirement.
1926,Sanders,"Trump is right that it would be useful to take a serious look at the Postal Service. He's dead wrong, however, if he believes the solution is to privatize the Postal Service. The reality is that since 2014 the Postal Service has made an operating profit of more than $2.7 billion."
1927,Sanders,"Trade is a good thing, but it must be fair. Instead of rejoining the TPP, we must fundamentally rewrite our failed trade policies in order to raise living standards for American workers and workers throughout the world."
1928,Sanders,American workers should not be forced into a race to the bottom. They should not have to compete against manufacturing workers in Vietnam who make as little as 72 cents an hour.
1929,Sanders,Make no mistake about it: Trump is dead wrong. There is no way to resuscitate the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership without betraying the working families of our country.
1930,Sanders,"In a series of broken promises Trump made to the working people of this country, rejoining the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership would be the biggest yet. Rejoining the TPP would be a betrayal of American workers and a step in the wrong direction."
1931,Sanders,"Today on Yom HaShoah we remember the 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust and recommit ourselves to the fight against anti-Semitism, bigotry and intolerance."
1932,Sanders,Mike Pompeo is a disastrous choice for secretary of state. His nomination must be defeated.
1933,Sanders,"It‚Äôs outrageous that the FBI is reportedly surveilling people they call ""Black Identity Extremists."" It's a disgraceful continuation of the FBI's history of spying on activists, especially people of color, fighting for social, racial and economic justice."
1934,Sanders,"The Arizona Supreme Court recently took away in-state tuition for DACA students, so young people like Fernando are struggling to figure out how to stay in school. This should not be happening in the United States of America."
1935,Sanders,"Five years ago, could you have believed that half of Americans would agree we need a single-payer health care system? When people see the justice of an idea, it spreads like wildfire. The American people know that health care should be a"
1936,Sanders,"Whether Trump likes it or not, it is Congress, not the president, who determines whether our country goes to war. Congress must not abdicate that responsibility."
1937,Sanders,Billionaires get tax breaks. Teachers get broken chairs and flooded classrooms. As the wealthiest nation in history we've got to do better.
1938,Sanders,This takeaway from the Mark Zuckerberg hearing gets to the heart of the issue: how do we use Facebook and the internet without seeing an invasion of our personal privacy?
1939,Sanders,"President Trump has no legal authority for broadening the war in Syria. It is Congress, not the president, who determines whether our country goes to war, and Congress must not abdicate that responsibility."
1940,Sanders,Do we really want to live in a country where students have to go to the hospital because of stress over paying for college? Or should we make public colleges and universities tuition-free while also lowering the outrageous levels of student debt?
1941,Sanders,Mark Zuckerberg testified today about Facebook‚Äôs role in our democracy. Here are the most important questions we should ask concerning his testimony:
1942,Sanders,This is an issue that impacts virtually every American. The American people have a right to know how companies are profiting from our information.
1943,Sanders,"This nation needs a serious conversation about the proper role of these companies. Should Facebook, Google and Amazon be allowed to control so much of the internet? How do ordinary citizens benefit from the internet without seeing an invasion of their personal lives?"
1944,Sanders,"Companies today know every aspect of a person‚Äôs life‚Äîwhere they go, what they do, their medical and financial records, whom they talk to, what they buy‚Äîand use that information to make billions in profit."
1945,Sanders,"While the internet has been an enormous source for good, all that convenience and connection comes with a price. Our privacy has been invaded in an unprecedented way and in a manner that would have been unthinkable even 20 years ago."
1946,Sanders,"Mark Zuckerberg testifying before the Senate is a good first step, but nowhere near enough. Today‚Äôs hearing must be the beginning, not the end, of the discussion about the dramatic impact Facebook, technology companies and the internet at large play in our society."
1947,Sanders,It's not a radical idea to say that women should get equal pay for equal work and the same economic opportunities as men. This is an issue of basic justice. #EqualPayDay
1948,Sanders,Pompeo supports the use of torture. He has longstanding relationships with anti-Muslim extremists. And his hawkish views on Iran and North Korea could very well lead us into another disastrous war. I will vote no on his nomination.
1949,Sanders,"Mike Pompeo is absolutely the wrong choice for secretary of state. He is a supporter of the Global Gag Rule. He opposes LGBTQ rights. And as the top recipient of money from the Koch brothers, he's stymied action on one of our most serious security threats: global climate change."
1950,Sanders,"We do not need more evidence to show us that pipelines are dangerous and must be stopped. We need to break our addiction to fossil fuels, create a sustainable energy system and end these disasters for"
1951,Sanders,"Millions of people are raising money on GoFundMe right now to fund their health care and life-saving medication. To my mind, that is not a functioning health care system. We must pass Medicare for all."
1952,Sanders,"Republicans are already using the huge increase in the debt that they caused as an excuse to make major cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. That is unacceptable."
1953,Sanders,"Over and over, Trump falsely claimed that his $1.5 trillion tax cut bill would pay for itself. Today‚Äôs CBO report puts that myth to rest. Trump‚Äôs massive tax break for the wealthy and large corporations is the primary reason that the federal deficit will explode."
1954,Sanders,"I don't often agree with George Will, a conservative columnist. But he's right on this issue. It's an outrage that millions of Americans are denied the right to vote because of felony convictions."
1955,Sanders,"I stand with Vermont state employees and retirees. Workers across the country are being squeezed by flat wages and rising health care costs. Our public sector workers must have access to fair wages, health care, needed medicines and a secure retirement."
1956,Sanders,"Nearly 200 days after Hurricane Maria, in the richest country in the history of the world, some Puerto Ricans still don't have power ‚Äì but billionaires got tax cuts."
1957,Sanders,We are not living in a poor nation. We are living in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. How do we have one of the highest rates of childhood poverty of any major country? How could it be that we don't guarantee health care to all people? We must demand change.
1958,Sanders,The legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is not just remembering him. The legacy is for us to follow in his footsteps and transform our country.
1959,Sanders,Martin Luther King Jr. was a nonviolent revolutionary. It is up to us to follow in his footsteps and carry forth his mission to abolish racism and poverty. #MLK50 #IAM2018
1960,Sanders,Hearing what‚Äôs on the minds of young people in Memphis before we march for #MLK50.
1961,Sanders,"In the richest country in the history of the world, our teachers should be the best-paid in the developed world, not among the worst-paid. The teachers who are protesting now are an inspiration to all of us."
1962,Sanders,"50 years ago today Martin Luther King Jr. delivered a speech in Memphis, Tennessee as he stood in solidarity with sanitation workers who were on strike for better wages and working conditions. Listen to the speech"
1963,Sanders,Let us never forget that at the time of his death Martin Luther King was organizing a multi-racial Poor People's Campaign and that he was assassinated in Memphis as he supported sanitation workers who were on strike for better wages and working conditions.
1964,Sanders,I'll join civil rights and labor leaders tomorrow in Memphis to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's assassination. Dr. King was not only one of the great civil rights leaders of the 20th century. He was also at the forefront of the fight for economic justice.
1965,Sanders,"Somebody told me that West Virginia, Oklahoma and Kentucky are ""red"" states. They got that wrong. These are the states where teachers are now leading the nation in the fight for workers' rights and adequate funding for education. Thank you teachers!"
1966,Sanders,The situation in Gaza is desperate. The unrest in Gaza will not end until the people there see hope for a decent future. The U.S. must work to bring Israel and the Palestinians together to end the blockade and develop policies that works for all.
1967,Sanders,"Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza remains a humanitarian disaster. The U.S. must play a more positive role in ending the Gaza blockade and helping Palestinians and Israelis build a future that works for all."
1968,Sanders,The killing of Palestinian demonstrators by Israeli forces in Gaza is tragic. It is the right of all people to protest for a better future without a violent response.
1969,Sanders,"How absurd is it that we live in a country where Congress and many states give huge tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, but fail to provide adequate funding for education?"
1970,Sanders,"It started in West Virginia. It continued into Oklahoma and it's now spreading to Arizona. Teachers are demanding respect for education and educators. They are standing up, fighting back ‚Äì and making real progress. CHANGE IS"
1971,Sanders,"For the future of our country, the credibility of our commitments, and the well-being of our armed forces, Congress cannot continue to abdicate the constitutionally mandated war-making responsibilities which the founding fathers gave to them."
1972,Sanders,"What are our priorities as a nation? Congress gives huge tax breaks to billionaires, while teachers in Oklahoma and other states are living on poverty-level salaries. Congratulations to the teachers in Oklahoma for standing up and fighting back."
1973,Sanders,Our veterans have put their lives on the line. We must do everything possible to ensure they receive the benefits they deserve ‚Äì not privatize the VA. Thank you to those who met in White River Junction today.
1974,Sanders,"Dr. David Shulkin, who has just been fired by Trump as Secretary of the VA, is right. We must not allow the VA to be privatized. Our job is to strengthen the VA, not dismember"
1975,Sanders,"It's appalling that 10,000 people with disabilities died last year awaiting a decision from the Social Security Administration. This spending bill is a start to address the underfunded SSA, but we must keep working to expand and strengthen Social"
1976,Sanders,Every major veterans‚Äô organization in this country vigorously opposes the privatization of the VA. I stand with them. The Veterans Affairs Committee should not approve any nominee for secretary who supports the privatization of the VA.
1977,Sanders,"Linda Brown was an American heroine. Thanks to her struggle and sacrifice for equality, African American children today have greater access and better opportunities for quality education and higher-paying jobs. Linda Brown‚Äôs struggle for equality will live on forever."
1978,Sanders,One way to destroy Social Security is to underfund and understaff the Social Security Administration. That is what Republicans have been doing. I am glad to have helped lead the effort to reverse that situation. It's a start.
1979,Sanders,"""The entire purpose of this is to lower middle class taxes."" ‚ÄìPaul Ryan""Primarily, and priority number 1, is middle-class Americans."" ‚ÄìSarah Huckabee Sanders""The theme behind this bill is to get middle-class tax relief."" ‚ÄìMitch McConnellThe reality:"
1980,Sanders,"""When we try to understand what's causing economic inequality, it's critical to look beyond the politicians and the parties at the actual corporate people who are pulling the strings."" ‚ÄìProfessor Gordon Lafer"
1981,Sanders,It is an outrage that we are still seeing intolerable acts of violence being perpetrated by police against black and brown people across the country. We need a societal transformation and real police and criminal justice reform. My thoughts are with Stephon‚Äôs family.
1982,Sanders,"""Here it is, we're giving millionaires tax cuts. You're going to give them $27,000... I can't even say that's half of my salary."" Arizona teachers like Tomorrah Howard are standing up to fight for fair pay."
1983,Sanders,"The struggle at the VA is about Trump's desire to privatize the VA and his belief that Shulkin is not moving fast enough in that direction. The Senate Veterans Committee, on which I serve, must stand with the veterans of our country and oppose all efforts to privatize the VA."
1984,Sanders,"‚ÄúYoung people, you have it in you to shout. It is up to you not to keep quiet. Even if others keep quiet, if we older people and leaders keep quiet, if the whole world keeps quiet and loses its joy, I ask you: Will you cry out?‚Äù ‚Äì Pope Francis"
1985,Sanders,It's a beautiful day for the #MarchForOurLives in Montpelier. Thank you to the young people who are leading us today.
1986,Sanders,"Transgender people have served and continue to serve our country honorably in the military. Unfortunately, this administration is not treating them honorably. The struggle for equality for all Americans continues, and Trump's efforts to divide us will not succeed."
1987,Sanders,The Trump administration has shown once again that it is on the wrong side of history. There is a reason the administration has not provided any scientific evidence to justify this policy: there is no justification for this sort of discrimination.
1988,Sanders,I want to congratulate everyone who is participating in the #MarchForOurLives today. Congress must have the guts to listen to the vast majority of the American people and not just the NRA.
1989,Sanders,John Bolton is the next National Security Advisor. That should scare everyone. Here are four reasons why:
1990,Sanders,"It was true in 1993 and it is true now: the time is long, long overdue for the United States to join the rest of the industrialized world and have a universal health care system."
1991,Sanders,"And after providing a massive tax break for the wealthy that will blow a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit, Trump complains about the domestic spending initiatives secured by the Democratic Caucus to address the needs of working families and the middle class."
1992,Sanders,"After rescinding the DACA program in September and opposing every piece of legislation to help the Dreamers, Trump blames Democrats for a problem that he created."
1993,Sanders,This was probably one of the most bizarre press conferences a president has ever had. Trump's hypocrisy and ignorance is no longer laughable. It is frightening.
1994,Sanders,The American people are tired of our broken health care system. Poll after poll shows that the majority of Americans know that we can do better and that we should pass Medicare for all to finally make health care a right.
1995,Sanders,John Bolton was part of the effort to mislead the US into the disastrous Iraq war and has supported military action against North Korea and Iran. He was too extreme to be confirmed as UN ambassador in 2005 and is absolutely the wrong person to be national security advisor now.
1996,Sanders,"""There virtually has never been a substantial black middle class, if we're defining it in terms of wealth."" - @DarrickHamilton"
1997,Sanders,"How is it that while the very, very wealthiest Americans have never had it so good, the middle class has been in decline for the last 30 years?"
1998,Sanders,I stand with Jetblue inflight crew members as they vote on joining @transportworker. All workers should have a union fighting for their rights at work.
1999,Sanders,"""Many of the people that have moved from the middle-class, have moved up!"" ‚Äì That was Fox News' response to our inequality town hall..."
2000,Sanders,"What frightens me is not only Trump's respect and admiration for tyrants all over the world, but his disrespect for democracy in our country.Our job is to stand together and say: Mr. Trump, in this country we believe in democracy, not authoritarianism."
2001,Sanders,"What was the corporate media discussing while we were talking about inequality in America? Let me guess, Stormy Daniels."
2002,Sanders,"The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, with U.S. support, has been a humanitarian disaster. Instead of supplying bombs and refueling capabilities, we should be doing everything possible to create a peaceful resolution to that civil war and provide humanitarian help."
2003,Sanders,"I'm deeply disappointed that Congress again abdicated its constitutional duty to authorize war. Over and over, Congress has sat back and failed to ask the hard questions as administrations have misled us into conflicts, including Vietnam and Iraq, with disastrous consequences."
2004,Sanders,6 months after Hurricane Maria we are still seeing a humanitarian crisis with schools being closed and people struggling to get clean drinking water. 1 in 10 people in Puerto Rico still have no electricity ‚Äì in the wealthiest nation on earth. That is a disgrace.
2005,Sanders,"The truth about Yemen is that U.S. forces have been actively engaged in support of the Saudi coalition in this war, providing intelligence and aerial refueling of planes whose bombs have killed thousands of people and made this humanitarian crisis far worse."
2006,Sanders,"LBJ‚Äôs administration misled Congress and the American people into the Vietnam War, just as the Bush administration misled us into the Iraq War. Time and again we see disasters when leaders refuse to tell the truth and when Congress is not actively involved in finding the truth."
2007,Sanders,The American people were lied to and misled by the Bush administration into believing that the Iraq war was necessary to prevent another 9/11. And Congress did not challenge them on those claims the way it should have.
2008,Sanders,Let me give you two reasons why Congress must reassert its constitutional authority over war: the war in Iraq and the war in Vietnam. In both wars Congress sat back and failed to ask the hard questions as two administrations led us into conflicts with disastrous consequences.
2009,Sanders,"So far as a result of the Saudi-led war in Yemen:-Over 10,000 civilians have been killed-Over 3 million have been displaced-15 million people lack access to clean water and sanitation-More than 1 million cases of cholera have been reported"
2010,Sanders,"I expect that colleagues today will be arguing that we are not really engaged in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Well, tell that to the people of Yemen, whose homes and lives are being destroyed by weapons marked ‚ÄúMade in the USA,"" dropped by planes refueled by the U.S. military."
2011,Sanders,"The Founding Fathers gave the power to authorize military conflicts to Congress, the branch most accountable to the people. For far too long Congress, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has abdicated its Constitutional role in authorizing war."
2012,Sanders,Congress must reassert its Constitutional authority over the issue of war
2013,Sanders,"For far too long Congress, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has abdicated its Constitutional role in authorizing war. That is the debate we are going to have today."
2014,Sanders,It‚Äôs not good enough to just be against Trump. We have to have a vision for this country of where we‚Äôre going to go. #InequalityTownHall
2015,Sanders,How do we reenergize the American people to stand up and take on the 1% who is prepared to step on everyone in their way?#InequalityTownHall
2016,Sanders,"Since the 1990s, the financial sector has spent over $3.2 billion on campaign contributions, and last year alone spent over $200 million on lobbying. #InequalityTownHall"

2020,Sanders,I say to those in the mainstream media: start turning your attention to the millions of people who are in poverty and struggling every day. #InequalityTownHall
2021,Sanders,One of the hardest things that has to happen now is for ordinary people to stand up and say: this is United States of America and the pain that we're seeing should not be happening. #InequalityTownHall
2022,Sanders,"Poverty is a death sentence. About 130,000 Americans die each and every year from poverty. #InequalityTownHall"
2023,Sanders,"Joining us now: Catherine Coleman Flowers, founder of the Alabama Center for Rural Enterprise Community Development Corporation. #InequalityTownHall https://t.co/tBSgmt4Ski"
2024,Sanders,This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. And yet over 40 million Americans are living in poverty and we now have the highest childhood poverty rate of nearly any major country on Earth. #InequalityTownHall
2025,Sanders,What does our system of inequality mean to you and your family? #InequalityTownHall
2026,Sanders,"Since 2001, over 50,000 factories have been shut down in America. #InequalityTownHall"
2027,Sanders,"In 1979, the top one-tenth of 1% owned about 7% of our nation‚Äôs wealth. Today they own nearly 23%. #InequalityTownHall"
2028,Sanders,Tonight we're going to look at why the middle class has been in decline for 30 years while oligarchy is on the rise. #InequalityTownHall

2034,Sanders,"The rapid rise of oligarchy and wealth and income inequality is the great moral, economic, and political issue of our time. Join us at 7 PM ET tonight on Facebook Live for conversation about inequality in America."
2035,Sanders,Tomorrow night: a discussion on one of the biggest issues facing our country‚Äîthe likes of which you'd never see in the mainstream media. I hope you will tune in. https://t.co/TRj9oeUby4
2036,Sanders,"We need to ask the hard questions that the corporate media fails to ask: who owns America, and who has the political power? Why, in the richest country in the history of the world are so many Americans living in poverty?"
2037,Sanders,"I was proud to have worked with Rep. Louise Slaughter during my 16 years in the U.S. House of Representatives. Throughout her career, Louise was a leading figure in the fight for economic, social and racial justice. She will be missed by her constituents and the entire country."
2038,Sanders,Monday night at 7 PM ET we are holding an incredibly important town hall on the rise of oligarchy and the collapse of the middle class. I hope you will join us.
2039,Sanders,"Today is the last day to apply for summer internships with Senator Sanders in his Burlington and Washington, DC offices. See here for more information: https://t.co/EPSZUJsFvB"
2040,Sanders,"Whether or not it's talked about on the major networks, income and wealth inequality is one of the defining issues of our time. Please join me, @SenWarren, @MMFlint, @DarrickHamilton and others on Facebook Monday, March 19 for an incredibly important discussion."
2041,Sanders,Thank you @NAACP President @DerrickNAACP and @marjInnocent for coming in to discuss community engagement and support for health equity and public schools. I greatly appreciate the work you are doing.
2042,Sanders,"""I'm here to fight for my life because we're scared. We never know if we're going to come back home from school."" ‚Äì High School Student Cindy Marquez"
2043,Sanders,"If you want to know why the American people have so much contempt for what goes on in Congress it is because time after time after time, the Republican leadership in Congress is doing the exact opposite of what the American people want."
2044,Sanders,"Next Monday, March 19th, we will be live streaming a discussion the likes of which you'd never see in the mainstream media. I hope you will tune in.https://t.co/TRj9oeCAGw"
2045,Sanders,What kind of message does it send when a defense contractor is paid 100 times more than the secretary of defense? Corporate interests should never take precedence over the interests of taxpayers or our national
2046,Sanders,Thank you to the young people throughout this country who are walking out today and who have the courage to do what the United States Congress is not doing: lead us forward to stop the slaughter that we have seen from coast to coast due to gun violence. #NationalWalkoutDay
2047,Sanders,"Many Americans are unaware that the people of Yemen are suffering today in a devastating civil war, or that U.S. forces have been actively engaged in support of the Saudi coalition in this war.https://t.co/hcOGRJGaAS"
2048,Sanders,Firing the secretary of state by tweet is no way to run a foreign policy. Countries around the world are looking to the U.S. for signs of stability and leadership. Trump is sending the opposite message.
2049,Sanders,"Here's the good news: since November 2012, more than 20 states and 40 cities and counties have raised their minimum wages. We're winning the fight for a living wage."
2050,Sanders,This is what happens when you have a multi-billionaire who has never attended or taught in a public school as the secretary of education.
2051,Sanders,"Unbelievably, Congress right now wants to deregulate some of the same banks that helped cause the 2008 financial disaster. That is really unacceptable."
2052,Sanders,The Trump budget is just the Republican three-step dance. My friend @RepJayapal breaks it down.
2053,Sanders,"Loudly and clearly, we must tell Republicans leaders: no, we will not cut Social Security benefits for seniors and disabled veterans."
2054,Sanders,I couldn‚Äôt resist a chance to ask that CNN talk about the real issues affecting the American people.
2055,Sanders,"‚ÄúInstead of arming schools... what our education system needs is resources that support the healthy social, emotional and academic development of all students.‚Äù ‚ÄìKaren Dolan, @IPS_DC"
2056,Sanders,"Today on #InternationalWomensDay‚Äîand every day‚Äîwe must commit to building a country and world where all women are safe, have equal opportunity and the social, racial and economic justice they deserve. We will not go backward on women's rights. We will move forward."
2057,Sanders,The CEO of Honeywell made 333 times the amount of money as the company's median worker last year. That is an outrage.
2058,Sanders,"Wealth and income inequality is the great moral, political and economic issue of our time, yet it gets very little coverage from the corporate media. Join me, @SenWarren, @MMFlint and more on March 19 for an in-depth conversation on inequality in America. https://t.co/TRj9oeCAGw"
2059,Sanders,"Charles Koch wrote in the Washington Post today that ""we should all question the fairness of the system"" when companies can pressure politicians. Well, here's how billionaires like the Kochs use their wealth to influence our political system and give themselves tax breaks:"
2060,Sanders,"Charles Koch to Paul Ryan: Here's $500K for giving me a massive tax cut at working families' expense.Also Charles Koch: ‚ÄúWhen large companies can pressure politicians to force everyday Americans to fork over unearned millions, we should all question the fairness of the system.‚Äù"
2061,Sanders,A multinational corporation taking huge sums of money from taxpayers should not be paying workers starvation wages. I stand with the workers who are fighting back against low wages and wage theft.
2062,Sanders,"What issue do you think got more coverage on CNN today, the effort to deregulate the major banks or Donald Trump and a porn star? Think hard!"
2063,Sanders,"Does it make sense that we pay the Secretary of Defense $200,000 or less and we give a contractor, who gets 92 percent of his revenue from the taxpayers of this country, $18 million in taxpayer money?"
2064,Sanders,"The Koch brothers and other right-wing groups are trying to destroy unions in America, and that's exactly what the Janus Supreme Court case is about."
2065,Sanders,"I am excited to have @keithellison take the lead in the House on the fight to pass a Medicare-for-all health care system. With his leadership, I know we will be able to take on the greed of health insurance and pharmaceutical companies and finally guarantee health care to all."
2066,Sanders,Here is why I am opposing the bill being voted on in the Senate now to deregulate some of the largest banks in America.
2067,Sanders,"I have a radical idea. Instead of listening to lobbyists in Washington, maybe, just maybe, we should listen to the American people who believe we should strengthen, not weaken, Wall Street regulations."
2068,Sanders,"Since the 1990s, the financial sector has given more than $3.2 billion in campaign contributions, and last year spent over $200 million on lobbying. That is why Congress will be spending day after day trying to make life easier for large financial institutions."
2069,Sanders,"Why is Congress busy worrying about the needs of huge financial institutions, but ignores the concerns of ordinary Americans? The answer is simple. Follow the money."
2070,Sanders,"I hear from a lot of people in Vermont and around the country. I have not heard one person say, ""Bernie, we have got to deregulate 25 of the largest banks in this country with cumulative assets of $3.5 trillion."" Yet that is what Congress is debating doing today."
2071,Sanders,Today my Republican colleagues along with some Democrats tell us that we should be spending our time deregulating some of the largest banks in America. How absurd is that? https://t.co/Goap3W4LOd
2072,Sanders,"At a time of massive concentration of ownership in the financial sector, now is not the time to deregulate banks that have more than $3.5 trillion in assets and lay the groundwork for another massive financial collapse."
2073,Sanders,"Are our memories so short that we have learned nothing from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression just 10 years ago? Unbelievably, Congress now wants to deregulate some of the same banks that helped cause the 2008 financial disaster."
2074,Sanders,These guys in the pharmaceutical industry in my humble opinion are crooks.
2075,Sanders,This banking bill is a disaster. The Wall Street crash of 2008 showed the American people how fraudulent many of these large banks are. The last thing we should be doing is deregulating them.
2076,Sanders,The US has nearly 17 times the gun homicide rate of Germany. So what's the difference? Our gun laws.
2077,Sanders,Why would any member of Congress vote to move us closer to another taxpayer bailout of large financial institutions?
2078,Sanders,"Remember:‚û°Ô∏è Trump revoked DACA in September‚û°Ô∏è Republicans control the House, Senate and White House‚û°Ô∏è Trump killed a bipartisan deal to protect DreamersWe must stand with Dreamers to stop Trump from throwing them out of the only country they've ever known. #DreamActNow"
2079,Sanders,Listen to this Florida public school teacher: arming teachers is not the answer to our mass shooting crisis.
2080,Sanders,"The Constitution is explicit. It is Congress and only Congress that can authorize American participation in war. That is why @SenMikeLee, @ChrisMurphyCT and I introduced a resolution that would end U.S. intervention in the Saudi led war in Yemen unless Congress authorizes it."
2081,Sanders,"100 years ago West Virginia coal miners helped lead the struggle for fair wages and dignity on the job. Today, the teachers of West Virginia are carrying on that brave tradition. I stand with them in their fight for justice and dignity."
2082,Sanders,"Our economy won't succeed unless we have the best educated workforce in the world. That won't happen if teachers are underpaid and disrespected. Congratulations to the teachers of West Virginia who are standing up for their students, for workers' rights and for a better future."
2083,Sanders,@MonaChalabi Thank you @MonaChalabi for the important illustration of gun violence in our country.
2084,Sanders,"We cannot allow public schools to be closed, privatized and turned into charter schools that care more about profit than educating Puerto Rico‚Äôs"
2085,Sanders,"Since 1968, there have been more than 1.5 million gun-related deaths on US territory. Since the founding of the United States, there have been about 1.4 million Americans killed in wars."
2086,Sanders,"""All of veterans, we did not fight for Blue Cross Blue Shield. We fought for the U.S.A."" - Denise Rohan, National Commander."
2087,Sanders,"If Mike Pence actually wants to protect life, he can start with ending this administration‚Äôs attacks on women and health care in America."
2088,Sanders,"These Patriotic Millionaires understand what a disastrous Supreme Court decision Citizens United was. Democracy should be one person, one vote. Not Billionaires buying elections."
2089,Sanders,"Workers earning $7.25 an hour must work an extra 41 days just to make the same amount they did in 2009, the last time Congress raised the federal minimum wage. It is way past time we take action and pay workers a living wage of $15 an"
2090,Sanders,"Thank you @SenatorDurbin @SenWarren @CoryBooker for co-sponsoring our War Powers Resolution on Yemen, and joining our effort to reassert Congressional authority in matters of war."
2091,Sanders,"If the president or members of Congress believe that support for the war in Yemen is in the U.S. interest, and that we should be involved in it, let them come before Congress, make their case, and let us vote on it.https://t.co/cmNfriVmuB"
2092,Sanders,"Every 10 minutes, a child under the age of five dies of preventable causes in Yemen. What few Americans know, however, is that the U.S. military is making the crisis worse by helping one side in the conflict bomb innocent civilians."
2093,Sanders,We have become far too comfortable with the United States engaging in military interventions all over the world. The time is long overdue for Congress to reassert its constitutional role in determining when and where our country goes to war.
2094,Sanders,"Without Congressional authorization, our engagement in the war in Yemen should be restricted to providing desperately needed humanitarian aid, and diplomatic efforts to resolve it."
2095,Sanders,It is unconstitutional for the United States to continue its involvement in the war in Yemen without Congressional approval. https://t.co/8Uomv5jxp3
2096,Sanders,"At 4:30 PM today, @SenMikeLee @ChrisMurphyCT and I will introduce a joint resolution calling for an end to U.S. support for the Saudi war in Yemen. Tune in:"
2097,Sanders,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pathetic that we‚Äôre so wrapped up around AR-15s that we don‚Äôt want to protect children.‚Äù ‚Äìretired Lt. Colonel Ralph Peters
2098,Sanders,I hope that in a bipartisan way we can come together and do what the overwhelming majority of American people want us to do: pass commonsense gun safety legislation to keep our children and families safe.
2099,Sanders,"5) Finally, we must make it easier for law enforcement to keep guns away from those accused of domestic violence or under a restraining order."
2100,Sanders,4) We need to provide more resources for those with mental health issues and make it harder for people with red flags to obtain weapons. People who are suffering from a mental health crisis should be able to get the health care they need.
2101,Sanders,3) We should reinstate the ban on assault weapons in this country‚Äîweapons which are designed for no other purpose but to kill human beings.
2102,Sanders,"2) We must crack down on ""straw men"" purchasers, when people legally buy guns and then sell them to people who cannot get them legally."
2103,Sanders,"1) We must seriously strengthen universal background checks, including ending the gun show loophole. Background checks don't mean anything if somebody can go into a gun show or the internet and buy weapons without undergoing any background check."
2104,Sanders,The American people are demanding that we have the courage to stand up to the NRA and finally take some action to move us in the right direction on gun safety. Let me suggest some of the ways in which I believe we should go forward in a bipartisan way.
2105,Sanders,"The Parkland students went through an unbelievably traumatic experience. But because they are prepared not just to mourn, but to stand up and fight back, I think it's possible we are going to see real change."
2106,Sanders,The fight for #NetNeutrality is not over. Today my colleagues and I introduced a bill to undo the FCC's disastrous repeal of net neutrality. We can overturn the FCC's decision but we need your help.
2107,Sanders,Nobody thinks the issue of gun safety is going to be an easy issue to solve. But in some ways I think the shooting in Florida is going to be the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back.https://t.co/FPcSh2TG2A
2108,Sanders,"Thank you to the students from Parkland, Florida, who are doing everything they can to prevent another mass shooting like they experienced. These really are incredibly bright young people. Because of them, I think it's possible we are going to see real change."
2109,Sanders,"An important thread about how even people with health insurance struggle to pay for health care. We must move to Medicare for all and guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege."
2110,Sanders,Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply for an internship with Senator Sanders. Applications are due on March 16.
2111,Sanders,"Working people in this country need a seat at the bargaining table to fight for higher wages, decent health care, a secure retirement and a safe working environment. Public sector unions are that voice and the Supreme Court must not take that"
2112,Sanders,We want to hear from ordinary Americans who have experienced in their daily lives the consequences of an economy that leaves far too many behind. Please share your story.
2113,Sanders,"Last year Amazon's federal income tax rate was zero. That was apparently too much for my Republican colleagues. Under the Trump tax bill, Amazon will get an additional $789 million tax break on the profits they shifted to offshore tax havens."
2114,Sanders,"I would hope that because of the leadership of these young people, we can stop the slaughter of children in our schools. I applaud these kids immensely for standing up and speaking out."
2115,Sanders,"I'm proud that the Vermont Senate voted to raise the state minimum wage to $15/hour, which will give a much‚Äìneeded raise to more than 65,000 Vermonters. I will continue to fight for a $15 federal minimum wage, because no worker in America should earn starvation wages."
2116,Sanders,Do you have a personal story to share about your or your family‚Äôs struggle to get by in today's economy? We want to hear from ordinary Americans who have experienced in their daily lives the consequences of an economy that leaves far too many behind.
2117,Sanders,I agree with Bill Gates. The last thing Congress should be doing is giving huge tax breaks to billionaires like him.
2118,Sanders,"I agree with Bill Gates. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the last thing Congress should do is give huge tax breaks to billionaires. The very wealthy should be paying more in taxes, not"
2119,Sanders,Happy to be home in Burlington. It's a warm and pleasant afternoon on Lake Champlain. #Vermont https://t.co/WVWL4grYOD

2121,Sanders,We must take on the NRA and pass commonsense legislation to keep our children safe.-Tighten background checks-End the gun show loophole-Crack down on people who buy guns legally for people who can‚Äôt-Ban civilian sale of semiautomatic assault weapons
2122,Sanders,We should not be selling assault weapons in this country. These weapons are not for hunting. They are for killing human beings. These are military weapons.
2123,Sanders,
2124,Sanders,"If Republicans actually listened to those in need, like Cara Sachs, maybe they would understand that ""entitlement reform"" will devastate the lives of millions of Americans."
2125,Sanders,President Trump's immoral budget will cut Social Security benefits for millions of hardworking Americans. And that means he lied to the American people.
2126,Sanders,"I thank German Ambassador @AmbWittig for joining me in Vermont this past weekend. I have always believed it is important for us to learn about what goes on in other countries, and there is plenty to be learned from Germany."
2127,Sanders,"Maybe, just maybe, after 18 school shootings in America in just 43 days of 2018 the Congress might want to consider common-sense gun safety legislation and save innocent lives."
2128,Sanders,Another horrific shooting. Another unspeakable horror. My thoughts are with everyone at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after this terrible day.
2129,Sanders,Don't just weep. Fight for a progressive agenda to reduce income and wealth inequality.
2130,Sanders,"Congratulations to gold-medalist @chloekimsnow, a first-generation American. Her father emigrated from South Korea to America in 1982 and worked his way up to an engineering job which he left to support her ambitions."
2131,Sanders,"You can't get 80 percent of the American people to agree on what type of ice cream is best, and yet you have an even larger majority now who agree on giving Dreamers protection and a path towards citizenship."
2132,Sanders,"As a result of Trump‚Äôs decision to revoke DACA, 122 people every day are losing their legal status. We have a moral responsibility today to stand up for the Dreamers and their families."
2133,Sanders,"I do not want to see what the history books will say about this Congress if we allow 800,000 Dreamers to be deported. It would be an indelible moral stain on our country if we fail to act."
2134,Sanders,"This whole debate over immigration and the Dreamers has become somewhat personal for me, because it has reminded me‚Ä¶"
2135,Sanders,Happy Valentine's day to all the millionaires who will not have to pay into Social Security for the rest of the year. Let's lift the cap and end this absurdity.
2136,Sanders,Ready for a really bad idea? Gut funding for studying and tracking climate change while boosting the continued burning of planet-warming fossil fuels.
2137,Sanders,"Donald Trump will receive a tax break of up to $11 million a year as a result of the Republican tax plan he signed into law.Meanwhile, President Trump‚Äôs budget would eliminate after school programs for more than 1 million children."
2138,Sanders,Why does Mick Mulvaney think it's OK to cut heating assistance for low-income Americans while giving massive tax breaks to the Koch brothers?
2139,Sanders,"One of the great crises we face is the rise of authoritarianism. Whether it's Putin, Trump, Duterte or Viktor Orban in Hungary, we are seeing attacks against freedom of the press, democratic election laws and an independent judiciary."
2140,Sanders,Fox News is afraid that the American people will find out the truth about Canada's single-payer health care.
2141,Sanders,You‚Äôre not a ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù kind of Republican by proposing a budget that would eliminate heating assistance to 6 million families in this country by abolishing the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
2142,Sanders,You don‚Äôt help working people when your budget would eliminate financial aid to hundreds of thousands of low-income college students.
2143,Sanders,"You don‚Äôt help working families by throwing more than 100,000 kids off of Head Start."
2144,Sanders,"As a candidate, Donald Trump said he understood the pain that working families were feeling. Well, you‚Äôre not responding to that pain, Mr. President, when you kick 500,000 families out of their homes by gutting affordable housing programs."
2145,Sanders,"The Trump budget is the budget of the Koch brothers, of the billionaire class."
2146,Sanders,The Trump budget is morally bankrupt. It is nothing less than an attack on the poor and a major transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 1 percent.
2147,Sanders,"If you were wondering how Trump plans to pay for his tax cuts for billionaires and corporations, now you know: with $1.8 trillion in cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security."
2148,Sanders,"Instead of creating more giveaways to corporate America, we should be eliminating corporate tax loopholes and using this revenue to directly invest over $1 trillion to modernize our nation‚Äôs infrastructure and create 15 million good-paying jobs."
2149,Sanders,"Trump is right to talk about the need to rebuild our infrastructure, but his proposal is dead wrong. Trump would encourage states to sell our nation‚Äôs highways, bridges, and other vital infrastructure to Wall Street and saddle Americans with new tolls and fees."
2150,Sanders,"The Trump budget is morally bankrupt and bad economic policy. It pays for his tax breaks for the rich and large corporations by slashing Medicaid by $1.3 trillion, cutting Medicare by $554 billion and slicing $10 billion from the Social Security Disability Insurance Program."
2151,Sanders,"Scott Pruitt, the head of the EPA, thinks that climate change could potentially be good for humans. Does he also think an asteroid hitting the Earth would be good for humans?"
2152,Sanders,We must not allow our younger generation to have a lower standard of living than their parents. One way to create good paying jobs is to grow the trade union movement and fight for decent wages and
2153,Sanders,Access to affordable home energy is not a luxury. It is a matter of life and death. No American should go cold in the wintertime. Trump must fund the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program at no less than $5.1 billion in his upcoming budget.
2154,Sanders,"Second, the $165 billion increase in defense spending is much too large. I believe in a strong military, but at a time when the U.S. spends more on defense than the next 12 countries combined, the last thing we should do is massively increase the Pentagon‚Äôs budget."
2155,Sanders,"However, I will be voting no. This bill does not address the great moral issue of our time ‚Äì the fact that in three weeks 800,000 young Dreamers will lose their legal status and be subject to deportation."
2156,Sanders,"I'm proud of initiatives I fought for in the budget agreement that increase funding for child care, the Social Security Administration, Veterans Administration, community health centers, student debt relief, our crumbling infrastructure, the opioid epidemic and disaster recovery."
2157,Sanders,"Thank you to the @nwlc for your strong advocacy on this issue. All families must have access to affordable child care, and that is why we just doubled funding to expand child care and development in America."
2158,Sanders,.@SpeakerRyan: A bi-partisan majority of House members support strong legislation to protect Dreamers. Let them vote. Let democracy rule.
2159,Sanders,Watch this progressive Congresswoman @RepJayapal explain what fair immigration reform means on Fox News:
2160,Sanders,"Hey, Mr. President: Instead of copying France's military parade, why not copy France's health care system? Health care for all, low-cost prescription drugs, much less expensive."
2161,Sanders,"It‚Äôs time for Congress to step up and, like Alabama and other states, investigate the pharmaceutical industry. The manufacturers of opioids should be forced to testify before Congress and tell us what they knew about the addictiveness of opioids."
2162,Sanders,High-income countries around the world have figured out how to do universal health care. Why can't Republicans understand that?
2163,Sanders,"Just as we called on tobacco companies to testify about what they knew and when they knew it, we must demand that drug companies testify under oath about their knowledge of opioids‚Äô addictiveness."
2164,Sanders,"Despite Jeff Sessions' war on marijuana, a growing majority of the American people understand that we should allow states the right to move toward the decriminalization of marijuana, not reverse progress that has been made."
2165,Sanders,The great political issue now facing our country is not Democrat vs. Republican or progressive vs. conservative. It's much deeper than that. It's about democracy vs. authoritarianism.
2166,Sanders,"Our job is to remind Trump and his allies what democracy is all about. By our grassroots activism we will defend President Lincoln's words ‚Äúthat government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth."""
2167,Sanders,Yesterday Trump suggested that members of Congress who don't mindlessly stand and applaud his every word are guilty of ‚Äútreason.‚Äù The great political issue now facing our country is not Democrat vs. Republican. It's about democracy vs. authoritarianism.
2168,Sanders,"Norway ranks #3 out of 11 countries when it comes to health care outcomes, while Canada ranks #9. Guess who comes in last?"
2169,Sanders,"It is time for Congress to investigate the opioid crisis, to learn what the drug companies knew about these products and to hold them accountable."
2170,Sanders,"We need a new moral agenda where the poor and middle-class are lifted up, not left behind."
2171,Sanders,"Getting rid of gerrymandered districts is an important step in the fight against voter suppression, but we must go further. It is past time to restore the Voting Rights Act, expand early voting and implement automatic voter registration."
2172,Sanders,"As if workers' earnings weren't low enough already, President Trump now wants to make it legal for employers to steal workers' tips."
2173,Sanders,We know how important the early years of a child's life are. Why would we not make sure all children have access to high-quality learning programs like Head Start?
2174,Sanders,"Hey, Mr. President. The only people who love the current system are you, the drug companies and insurance companies. 30 million Americans have no health insurance and we pay the highest prices in the world. We must guarantee health care to all, not take it away."
2175,Sanders,This Canadian doctor can't believe how complicated and dysfunctional our health care system is:
2176,Sanders,"We've lost 900,000 jobs in two decades thanks to NAFTA. The status quo must change."
2177,Sanders,"We need to build a health care system that puts the lives of patients over the whims and profits of insurance companies, where being poor or unemployed or just unlucky doesn‚Äôt mean a death"
2178,Sanders,What is Trump afraid of? According to news reports President Trump himself has acknowledged that the release of the Nunes memo was designed to disrupt Robert Mueller‚Äôs investigation. No political stunt should interfere with the special counsel‚Äôs work.
2179,Sanders,The fact that Congressional Republicans and the White House would release a memo the FBI itself says is misleading is a sad example of a political party putting partisanship above patriotism.
2180,Sanders,The release of the Nunes memo is a blatant attempt by House Republicans and the White House to disrupt the critically important investigation into Russia‚Äôs interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.
2181,Sanders,This is the health care crisis no one is talking about. Congress must act immediately to fully fund community health centers.
2182,Sanders,"Sen. Sanders is seeking a full-time, paid press/video fellow. See here for details:"
2183,Sanders,Getting sick shouldn't mean you go bankrupt. But that is the reality for far too many Americans. Is that the case for you and your
2184,Sanders,"The American people want a government, an economy, an environment that works for all of us, not just the few. #FossilFree"
2185,Sanders,"Donald Trump spoke for over an hour last night on many issues, yet somehow he forgot to mention the words ""climate change."" He continues to believe that climate change is a ‚Äúhoax.‚Äù What an outrage."
2186,Sanders,"The short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry are not more important than the future of our planet. Join me, @350 and other leaders of the climate movement to demand a #FossilFree future.https://t.co/UnBG5onTo8"
2187,Sanders,"I know you might be shocked to hear this, but Trump got quite a number of things wrong last night in his State of the Union address."
2188,Sanders,"If you missed Bernie's response to Trump's State of the Union last night, watch here now: https://t.co/QYX7kM9Wgu"
2189,Sanders,My thoughts are with my colleagues and all those injured and killed in the train crash this morning.
2190,Sanders,"Last night we heard President Trump‚Äôs State of the Union, but what we did not hear was a single mention of climate change. Tonight, join me and tens of thousands of people across the U.S. as we tune in to chart the path to go"
2191,Sanders,Canadians are sick and tired of Republicans lying about their health care.
2192,Sanders,"When ordinary people stand up and fight for justice there is nothing that we cannot accomplish. That has been the history of America, and that is our future. #BernieResponds"
2193,Sanders,The Koch brothers and their billionaire friends plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2018 midterm elections. They may have the money. But we have the people. #BernieResponds
2194,Sanders,We are starting to see the beginning of a political revolution. Candidates from coast to coast are standing tall for a progressive agenda that works for the working families of our country and not just the billionaire class.  #BernieResponds
2195,Sanders,"We are seeing the growth of grassroots organizations and people from every conceivable background starting to run for office ‚Äì for school board, city council, state legislature, the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate. #BernieResponds"

2197,Sanders,The good news is that the vast majority of our people have a very different vision for the future of our country than what Trump and the Republican leadership are giving us. #BernieResponds
2198,Sanders,"The American people do not want a president who is trying to divide us up based on the color of our skin, our nation of origin, our religion, our gender, or our sexual orientation. #BernieResponds"
2199,Sanders,"Trump correctly talked about the need to address the opioid crisis. Well, I say to him, you don‚Äôt help people suffering from opioid addiction by cutting Medicaid by $1 trillion. We need to expand, not cut Medicaid. #BernieResponds"
2200,Sanders,Trump‚Äôs plan to privatize our nation‚Äôs infrastructure is an old idea that has never worked and never will work. #BernieResponds
2201,Sanders,Poll after poll shows that over 80 percent of the American people believe that we should protect the legal status of Dreamers and provide them with a path toward citizenship. We need to pass the bipartisan DREAM Act now. #BernieResponds
2202,Sanders,"It would be unspeakable and a moral stain on our nation if we turned our backs on the 800,000 young Dreamers who were born and raised in this country and who know no other home but the United States. #BernieResponds"
2203,Sanders,We need to seriously address the issue of immigration but that does not mean dividing families and reducing legal immigration by 25-50 percent. #BernieResponds
2204,Sanders,"Trump talked about DACA and immigration, but what he did not tell the American people is that he precipitated this crisis in September by repealing President Obama‚Äôs executive order protecting Dreamers. #BernieResponds"
2205,Sanders,"How can Trump not talk about the reality that Russia, through cyberwarfare, interfered in our election in 2016, is interfering in democratic elections all over the world, and according to his own CIA director will likely interfere in the 2018 midterm elections? #BernieResponds"
2206,Sanders,How can a president not talk about the inadequate funding and staffing at the Social Security Administration which has resulted in thousands of people with disabilities dying because they did not get their claims processed in time? #BernieResponds
2207,Sanders,"How can Trump not talk about the fact that in a highly competitive global economy, hundreds of thousands of bright young people are unable to afford to go to college, while millions of others have come out of school deeply in debt? #BernieResponds"
2208,Sanders,I don‚Äôt understand how a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change. #BernieResponds
2209,Sanders,Trump talked about how he was going to take on the greed of Wall Street which he said ‚Äúhas caused tremendous problems for us.‚Äù Then he appointed more Wall Street billionaires to his administration than any president in history. #BernieResponds
2210,Sanders,Trump told us that ‚Äúthe rich will not be gaining at all‚Äù under his tax plan. That was quite a whopper. The legislation Trump signed into law provides 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent. #BernieRespondshttps://t.co/0lFHRoIuA5
2211,Sanders,Trump talked about how he was going to lower prescription drug prices and take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. Then he nominated a former top executive of one of the largest drug companies for Secretary of Health and Human Services. #BernieResponds
2212,Sanders,"Trump promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. Then he supported a Republican budget resolution that proposed slashing Medicaid by $1 trillion and cutting Medicare by $500 billion. #BernieRespondshttps://t.co/0lFHRoIuA5"
2213,Sanders,"During his campaign, Trump told the American people he was going to provide health insurance for everybody. Last year, he supported legislation that would have thrown up to 32 million people off of health insurance. #BernieRespondshttps://t.co/0lFHRoIuA5"
2214,Sanders,The taxpayers of this country should not be providing corporate welfare to the wealthiest families in this country. #BernieResponds
2215,Sanders,"Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex and Huggies, recently said they were using money from the tax cut to restructure ‚Äì laying off more than 5,000 workers and closing 10 plants. #BernieResponds"
2216,Sanders,"Trump touted bonuses he claims workers received because of his ‚Äútax reform‚Äù bill. He forgot to mention only 2% of Americans report getting a raise or a bonus because of the tax bill, or that corporations are now laying off tens of thousands of employees. #BernieResponds"
2217,Sanders,"Here's the story that Trump failed to mention: since March, the three richest people in America saw their wealth increase by more than $68 billion. Meanwhile, the average worker saw an increase of‚Äîare you ready for this‚Äî4 cents an hour. #BernieResponds"
2218,Sanders,"I want to take a few minutes of your time to respond to Trump‚Äôs State of the Union speech. But I also want to talk to you about the major crises facing our country that, regrettably, Trump chose not to discuss. #BernieRespondshttps://t.co/eYk6BtUYxy"
2219,Sanders,President Trump‚Äôs State of the Union needs a response. Here‚Äôs mine.
2220,Sanders,Starting soon: Sen. Sanders' response to #SOTU at https://t.co/TIdQMUk3ML
2221,Sanders,"Apple's ""major"" announcement to invest $350 billion into the U.S. economy was a major PR move."
2222,Sanders,"I'm honored that Luis Alcauter will be my guest at the #StateOfTheUnion. Luis is not a statistic, and he is certainly not a bargaining chip. He is a human being who deserves our support. We cannot abandon Luis and all the other Dreamers."
2223,Sanders,Tonight at 10:45 ET: Sen. Sanders responds to Trump's State of the Union address on Facebook and YouTube. https://t.co/7VUSuKv5eK
2224,Sanders,"Could this be the beginning of the American business community understanding that a not-for-profit Medicare for All, single payer system makes sense not only for the average American, but for the business community as well?"
2225,Sanders,Tonight Donald Trump is going to be giving his #StateOfTheUnion address. I hope you'll join me at 10:45 PM EST for my response at https://t.co/7VUSuKv5eK
2226,Sanders,It turns out Apple's huge announcement to invest $350 billion into the U.S. economy was just a PR move.
2227,Sanders,"I could be wrong, but I don‚Äôt think Trump is going to be explaining tonight why he tried to throw 32 million people off of health insurance. #StateOfTheUnion"
2228,Sanders,"""We believe in Norway that our health system is for the people of Norway and should not function as a cash cow for drug companies."" ‚ÄìDr. Meetali Kakad"
2229,Sanders,"En algunos lugares como Morovis, PR, 1/3 de la poblaci√≥n sigue sin suministros de agua y alimentos. Esto es inaceptable. No deber√≠amos detener nuestra ayuda hasta que la crisis humanitaria haya terminado. Estos ciudadanos de EE.UU. merecen tener acceso a alimentos y agua limpios."
2230,Sanders,"In some areas, like Morovis, Puerto Rico, 1/3 of the population is still without critical food and water supplies. This is unacceptable. We should not end our disaster relief until the humanitarian crisis is over. These American citizens deserve access to clean food and water."
2231,Sanders,Join me tonight at 10:45 PM ET on Facebook Live for my response to President Trump's State of the Union address. I can promise you I‚Äôll have a lot to say.
2232,Sanders,"President Trump should apologize tonight for trying to divide our nation up based on where we were born, the color of our skin, our sexual orientation and our gender. #StateOfTheUnion"
2233,Sanders,"Republicans have decided to wage war against access to safe, affordable health care. We cannot go back to the days when women in America did not have the right to control their own bodies. Access to safe and legal abortion is a constitutional right."
2234,Sanders,"¬øSabes de qu√© no hablar√° Trump en el estado de la naci√≥n? Seguramente no se disculpar√° por las muchas mentiras que les dijo a los votantes estadounidenses: como prometi√≥ defender los intereses de los trabajadores, pero luego los vendi√≥ a Wall Street y la clase multimillonaria."
2235,Sanders,"You know what Trump won't be talking about in his State of the Union? He will surely not be apologizing for the many lies he told American voters: how he promised to defend the interests of working people, but then sold them out to Wall Street and the billionaire class."
2236,Sanders,Watch @RepRoKhanna tell Fox News why Medicare for all is the way forward when it comes to health care:
2237,Sanders,This is what oligarchy is all about. This is why we need to overturn the terrible Citizens United Supreme Court decision and move to public funding of
2238,Sanders,"I agree with @SenatorShaheen. We need a Senate investigation to understand how this decades-long pattern of sexual assault against young gymnasts could have gone on and on. We should be supportive of our young athletes in this country, not allow them to be horribly exploited."
2239,Sanders,"We spend far more on health care than France does, yet somehow their health outcomes are much better and they provide health care to every man, woman, and child in their country."
2240,Sanders,"Trump's position on climate change is pathetic and an embarrassment to the world. We must fight back. On Jan. 31, join me and tens of thousands of people across the U.S. as we tune in to chart the path to go #FossilFree."
2241,Sanders,There is no greater example of how politics works in America than this:
2242,Sanders,"While Donald Trump and the ""masters of the universe"" assemble in #Davos, the 6 richest people own as much wealth as the bottom half of the world's population ‚Äì 3.7 billion people. We need a global economy that works for all, not just multi-national corporations and the very rich."
2243,Sanders,The lies that occur here in Washington about health care systems around the world are really unbelievable.
2244,Sanders,"There's no reason why we shouldn't expand Medicare to every man, woman and child in this country. All it takes is will."
2245,Sanders,"""The message in New York City is that we‚Äôre going to respect everyone regardless of documentation status.‚Äù ‚Äì@NYCMayor https://t.co/KfozHHGOL9"

2250,Sanders,Here's what cable news was covering as we were discussing the most important issue facing our country.
2251,Sanders,Join me and @NYCMayor on The Bernie Sanders Show on Facebook Live at 12:30 ET today. Watch at https://t.co/TIdQMUk3ML
2252,Sanders,"The nomination of Alex Azar, who ran Eli Lilly‚Äôs U.S. operations over the last decade, shows that Trump‚Äôs campaign promises to lower drug prices were nothing more than empty campaign rhetoric."
2253,Sanders,"Thank you to the 1.1 million people who tuned in live to the first-ever national Medicare for All town hall tonight. Together we will successfully move the United States to a Medicare-for-all, single-payer health care system and guarantee health care to all."
2254,Sanders,"We are not going to win this fight unless all of us are actively involved, stand up, fight back and recognize that health care is a right, not a privilege. #MedicareForAll"
2255,Sanders,Toronto physician Dr. Danyaal Raza explains that having a single payer system does not mean having a lower quality system. Canada has longer life expectancy than in the U.S. and better health outcomes. #MedicareForAllhttps://t.co/K6hyrm444W
2256,Sanders,"""The Norwegian health service is based on the fundamental idea that everyone in Norway should have access to affordable and excellent health care."" ‚ÄìDr. Meetali Kakad #MedicareForAllhttps://t.co/K6hyrm444W"
2257,Sanders,What we are talking about exists in virtually every other major country on Earth. Think about starting a new business and not having to worry about whether your family will have health care. #MedicareForAll
2258,Sanders,In the last 20 years alone the pharmaceutical industry has spent $3.6 billion in lobbying. They have an endless amount of money and they use it to maintain a system which allows them to raise prices as they choose. #MedicareForAll
2259,Sanders,"Right now we have the absurd situation where in the last year the five largest pharmaceutical companies in America made $50 billion in profits, while millions of Americans could not afford their medication. #MedicareForAll"
2260,Sanders,Medicare is the most popular health insurance program in the country. #MedicareForAll
2261,Sanders,What would it mean for your family if health care was guaranteed to all as a right? #MedicareForAll
2262,Sanders,We need a health care system where people who are sick do not put off going to the doctor because they cannot afford it. #MedicareForAll
2263,Sanders,"We spend much, much more on health care per capita in the United States than any other major country and yet have worse outcomes. #MedicareForAll"
2264,Sanders,We have a health care system that is not designed to provide affordable health care to all. It's designed to make enormous profits for insurance companies and drug companies. #MedicareForAll
2265,Sanders,"""When we prescribe medications for patients, it's a circus."" For one patient a medication may cost $4, for another it may cost $1,2000, depending on insurance, says nurse practitioner Deborah Wachtel #MedicareForAllhttps://t.co/K6hyrm444W"

2267,Sanders,Far too often corporate television limits the nature of what we see and the discussions we have. This event will not be interrupted by commercials from drug or insurance companies or Wall Street. #MedicareForAllhttps://t.co/K6hyrm444W
2268,Sanders,There is something profoundly wrong when we are the only major country not to guarantee health care as a right. #MedicareForAll
2269,Sanders,STARTING NOW: The #MedicareForAll National Town Hall is live from Washington. It's time to make health care a
2270,Sanders,Starting in 30 minutes:
2271,Sanders,It's an international embarrassment that the United States is the only major country on Earth that doesn‚Äôt guarantee health care to all people as a right. That has got to change. We need to pass Medicare for All now. https://t.co/YgiVxxZBQv
2272,Sanders,We are the only major country not to make health care a right. Watch our Medicare for All National Town Hall tonight at 7 ET to learn how we can end that international embarrassment: https://t.co/YgiVxxZBQv
2273,Sanders,"Thanks for that question, John. I hope you tune in tonight to learn what Medicare for All would really do for Americans. https://t.co/YgiVxxZBQv"
2274,Sanders,The Medicare for All Town Hall is tonight at 7 ET. Are you hosting a watch party?https://t.co/YgiVxxZBQv
2275,Sanders,What we are doing tonight is a big deal. We are going to talk about what really matters to the American people. I hope you will join us in watching on Facebook at 7
2276,Sanders,What is it like to live in a country with universal health care?
2277,Sanders,Looking for an alternative? Tune in to tonight‚Äôs Medicare for All Town Hall at 7 PM ET on Facebook Live. https://t.co/YgiVxxZBQv
2278,Sanders,Our health care system is wasteful. It‚Äôs expensive. And it has worse outcomes than most other major countries. Watch the Medicare for All Town Hall tonight to learn how we can do better. https://t.co/YgiVxxZBQv
2279,Sanders,Tomorrow night is going to be a big deal. I hope you'll be a part of it.
2280,Sanders,Join me tomorrow night for the first-ever national town hall on Medicare for All.https://t.co/YgiVxxZBQv
2281,Sanders,Here is why I voted against Republicans' short-term spending bill today:
2282,Sanders,"Enough is enough. The Republican Party controls the House, Senate and White House. They have got to govern, not ignore the major crises facing this country."
2283,Sanders,"We're talking about the need to provide adequate disaster relief for the people of Texas, Florida, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico ‚Äì an island where hundreds of thousands are still without electricity."
2284,Sanders,We 're talking about many thousands of people with disabilities who will die because they couldn't get their claims processed in a timely manner by an underfunded and understaffed Social Security Administration.
2285,Sanders,We're talking about 27 million Americans who will find it harder and harder to get their health care through community health centers because that program has not yet been reauthorized.
2286,Sanders,"We're talking about the fate of 800,000 Dreamers who have lived here almost all of their lives, but could soon be faced with deportation if we don't act now."
2287,Sanders,"The reason I voted against today‚Äôs continuing resolution is simple: tens of millions of lives are at stake. We must act NOW, not kick the can down the road."
2288,Sanders,"Did you know that universal health care systems like Canada's are less expensive than the wasteful, bureaucratic system in America?"
2289,Sanders,Do you have a question about Medicare for All? Submit a video question here and you might get it answered at the Medicare for All Town Hall tomorrow
2290,Sanders,"‚ÄúAs an immigrant myself, I am tired of being called the worst of the worst. I am tired of hearing Mexicans be called rapists or Africans be called vulgarities that I cannot even repeat on this floor.‚Äù -@RepJayapal"
2291,Sanders,"If you think the shutdown we're experiencing right now isn't related to our disastrous campaign finance system, you would be dead wrong."
2292,Sanders,"This government shutdown is part of the long-term, anti-government ideology paid for by the Koch brothers."
2293,Sanders,"To have a president of the United States who says such outrageous nonsense, it is really sad."
2294,Sanders,Republicans: ‚úÖ  Control the House‚úÖ  Control the Senate‚úÖ  Control the presidency Do your job. Run the damn government. Pass a budget that protects working families.
2295,Sanders,"Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. The most fundamental responsibility of the governing party is to govern. I say to Republicans: Do your job."
2296,Sanders,We asked Republicans to pass a budget that would protect the needs of working families. They preferred to shut down the government instead.
2297,Sanders,"When it comes to providing tax breaks to billionaires, Republicans will rush to get it done.When it comes to passing a budget that protects the needs of working families‚Äîwell, we are still waiting."
2298,Sanders,Mitch McConnell is many things but he‚Äôs not dumb. He knows how to count. Bringing up a vote he knew was doomed an hour before the government shut down was absolutely irresponsible. This falls on his shoulders.
2299,Sanders,Here's why Democrats are standing up to Trump and Mitch McConnell:
2300,Sanders,We are saying to Mitch McConnell and President Trump: You are going to have to start dealing with the real issues facing this country.
2301,Sanders,"For the first time in history, a one-party government was unable to keep the government going. That is pathetic."
2302,Sanders,Republicans can't negotiate an agreement on what 87 percent of Americans agree on. That is where we are right now.
2303,Sanders,"I hope, based on last night's vote, that McConnell now changes his mind and begins to negotiate seriously. We must reopen the government as soon as possible."
2304,Sanders,I'm very disappointed that the Republicans chose to shut down the government. Leader McConnell insisted on going forward with a doomed vote rather than negotiating a serious agreement with the Democrats and Republicans who opposed him.
2305,Sanders,How come Republicans can't negotiate an agreement on what 87 percent of Americans agree on?
2306,Sanders,We need a clean DREAM Act now
2307,Sanders,"Lauren is one of the 800,000 young people who grew up in our country and is now living in fear of being deported."
2308,Sanders,Trump and the Republicans are using health insurance for 9 million children as a bargaining chip for a wall that will do more harm than good.
2309,Sanders,Has it really only been one year of Trump? It feels like 16 years.
2310,Sanders,"How the hell do you run a military on a month-to-month basis? You can't do it! Republicans, do your job, run the damn government."
2311,Sanders,We've got a government crisis right now. I want to hear your questions:https://t.co/yCO7s69hU8
2312,Sanders,I‚Äôm taking your questions on what the hell is going on with the government right now. Please leave a comment below.
2313,Sanders,In a few minutes I'll be taking your questions about the government shutdown. Watch on Facebook Live:
2314,Sanders,You cannot run a government on a month-to-month basis. We cannot continue to abdicate our responsibility. We must address the problems facing the American people.
2315,Sanders,This morning I say to Senator McConnell: Please do not shut the government down. Sit down with the Democrats and start negotiating a compromise agreement.
2316,Sanders,"Today I urge, in the strongest possible terms, that the Republican leadership in the Senate accept its responsibility and not allow the government to shut down. https://t.co/Dp2zRwXxoI"
2317,Sanders,"Republicans, listen to what the Pentagon told us: We cannot continue this uncertainty. How the hell do you run a military on a month-to-month basis. You can't do it. Republicans, do your job. Run the damn government."
2318,Sanders,It does not take great moral courage to pass an issue that nearly 9 in 10 Americans agree on ‚Äì to allow DACA recipients to stay in the only country they have ever known and have a pathway to citizenship. And yet Republicans will not allow that to
2319,Sanders,We must stop a government shutdown.
2320,Sanders,"When Republicans control the Senate, House and White House, and they blame Democrats for the shutdown, I don't think anybody is going to take that seriously."
2321,Sanders,"Republicans have got to fix the DACA crisis Trump precipitated. We are not going to allow 800,000 young Dreamers to be deported."
2322,Sanders,"Enough is enough. Republicans must compromise. It's time to stand up for Dreamers, working families and Puerto Rico.https://t.co/SaV9MZMgnr"
2323,Sanders,There is a health care crisis about to go down that virtually no one is talking about.
2324,Sanders,"Billionaires got their tax breaks last month, but for 113 days health insurance for 9 million children has been hanging in the balance."
2325,Sanders,"Mr. President, maybe the reason why more Americans emigrated to Norway last year than the other way around is because they have universal health care and a strong social democracy."
2326,Sanders,We must pass disaster relief right now which treats Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands just as we will treat Texas and Florida. We cannot continue to delay given the enormous suffering there.
2327,Sanders,We must stand with Dreamers to stop Donald Trump from throwing them out of the only country they have ever known.
2328,Sanders,"Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. They have to pass an annual budget, not more one-month continuing resolutions. We need a bipartisan solution to the economic crises facing the middle class, to the DACA crisis that Trump created and to disaster relief."
2329,Sanders,Trump wants a shutdown. These are the major issues that have to be dealt with to stop him from getting his way.https://t.co/2Scl4ssCkQ
2330,Sanders,Even this Republican wants the government to stop spying on Americans.
2331,Sanders,"You would think that Trump‚Äôs Secretary of Homeland Security might have met with a single Dreamer before planning to throw 800,000 of them out of the country."
2332,Sanders,Here's something you won't hear on Fox News: President Trump just presided over the worst overall year of job creation since 2010.
2333,Sanders,"We can and must protect our country from the serious potential of another terrorist attack without living in an Orwellian world where the government and private corporations can make warrantless searches of Americans' calls, emails and texts."
2334,Sanders,I will vote no on reauthorizing Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The bill as written gives the government far too much power to spy on innocent U.S. citizens.
2335,Sanders,We need one more Republican senator who has the decency to stand up to the telecom and cable industries and protect the American people. Let's find
2336,Sanders,"As Congress moves forward this week on the budget, we must stand with Dreamers. Taking away the legal status of 800,000 young people who were raised in this country and subjecting them to the possibility of deportation would be one of the cruelest acts in modern American history."
2337,Sanders,"To truly honor Dr. King we must fight to carry out his radical and bold vision for racial and economic justice in America and transform our national priorities. The struggle continues to this day, and our work is far from over. #MLKDay"
2338,Sanders,"Republicans want to increase defense spending by more than $150 billion over the next 2 years.Meanwhile, this same Republican Party hasn't reauthorized spending for the Children's Health Insurance Program or Community Health Centers."
2339,Sanders,"Taking on the greed of Wall Street, the power of gigantic multinational corporations and the influence of the global billionaire class is not only the moral thing to do ‚Äì it is a strategic geopolitical"
2340,Sanders,What does it feel like to be threatened with deportation?
2341,Sanders,"I've got news for those who thought Mexico was going to pay for Trump's pointless wall. It ain't Mexico who's gonna pay, it's you, the American taxpayer."
2342,Sanders,Democratic and Republican senators must continue efforts to produce a bi-partisan Dream Act that can be voted upon by the Senate as part of the overall budget deal.
2343,Sanders,"Republicans in Congress must now summon the courage to stand up to the racist ramblings of our ""stable genius"" president."
2344,Sanders,It‚Äôs not enough to just respond with anger. We have to build a political movement in this country which says that that is not who we are and we will not tolerate that type of moral inadequacy.
2345,Sanders,"All over this country are decent people who tell their kids, don‚Äôt judge people based on the color of their skin or the country they came from. Judge them on whether or not they are good human beings.We have a president telling the world that's not what he does."
2346,Sanders,"My dad came from what I guess Trump would call a ""shithole"" country. He was able to come to the U.S. and became a very proud American."
2347,Sanders,Let‚Äôs be absolutely clear about what Republicans are doing by adding work requirements to Medicaid: they are attacking the poor.
2348,Sanders,"Astoundingly, we have climate change policies being written by the world's biggest polluters. As @KateAronoff says, it is not enough to ask whether or not people believe in global warming, but what they can do to save this planet for future generations."
2349,Sanders,Have you lived abroad and seen firsthand what universal health care looks like? Apply to be a panelist at the Medicare for All Town Hall in Washington on Jan. 23.
2350,Sanders,Please take a moment to read the replies here. Every other major country has made health care a right. The U.S. is the anomaly. Remember that.
2351,Sanders,"Remember when CEOs said they'd create thousands of jobs if we gave them massive tax cuts? Well, AT&amp;T, Comcast and Pfizer just laid off hundreds of workers right after the Republicans passed their pathetic tax bill."
2352,Sanders,Do you live in a country with universal health care? What does that mean for you and your family? #MedicareForAll
2353,Sanders,On January 23 we're going to try to do something that's never been done before. I hope you'll join us.
2354,Sanders,The fight for net neutrality is not over. We can overturn the FCC's disastrous decision but we need your help.
2355,Sanders,The construction of a wall to keep unwelcome visitors out makes a lot of sense ‚Äî if you were living under the Ming Dynasty in China in the 15th century when the Great Wall of China was expanded.
2356,Sanders,What kind of a country are we if we deny health care to millions of children?
2357,Sanders,"We must not hold the lives of 800,000 young Dreamers hostage in order to fund a wall that the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose. Sadly, it appears that is exactly what Donald Trump wants."
2358,Sanders,This is one of the great moral issues of our time. It cannot be kicked down the road any longer. We must pass the DREAM Act now.https://t.co/ot8Qj4LFE5
2359,Sanders,"We don't need to spend $18 billion on a wall which, by the way, Trump said would be paid for by the Mexican government."
2360,Sanders,"Last night, President Trump received a standing ovation from a group of farmers after he told them they would no longer have to pay the estate tax. He forgot to mention that less than 0.1 percent of estate taxes are paid by small farmers."
2361,Sanders,"Kate and her family would not have been able to grow their organic farm without the help of the Children's Health Insurance Program. If Congress does not get its act together, 9 million children in working families will lose their health insurance."
2362,Sanders,Maybe Trump and Republican leaders believe a government shutdown would be a welcome distraction from the ongoing Russia investigation. But a shutdown would harm working-class families who would be unable to access vital services.
2363,Sanders,"While Trump and his billionaire friends play golf in Florida, low-income Americans and people with disabilities across this country are struggling to stay warm."
2364,Sanders,Does single-payer health care mean ‚Äúgovernment-run‚Äù health care? Canadian @docdanielle breaks it down:
2365,Sanders,The American people are increasingly disgusted with a government that protects the interests of the wealthy and the powerful. We must pass a budget agreement that addresses the needs of Americans and not just billionaire campaign
2366,Sanders,I don't know why President Trump and Republicans want to shut down the government over a wall no one wants and an unprecedented $100 billion increase in military spending. What the American people want is to protect Dreamers and working families.
2367,Sanders,Today marks 100 days since Congress let the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program expire. Let me say that again: health care for 9 million children has hung in the balance for 100 days. We must do better than this.
2368,Sanders,"Because the president revoked DACA, some 800,000 young people are living in extraordinary anxiety about whether or not they're going to lose legal status and be subject to deportation. We have got to deal with that decision."
2369,Sanders,We need to get our priorities right. Not giving tax breaks to billionaires. Not throwing millions of people off of health insurance. We have got to pay attention to the working families of the this country.
2370,Sanders,"The Republicans control the White House, they control the Senate, they control the House. They will determine whether or not there is a government shutdown. I certainly hope there is not a government shutdown."
2371,Sanders,The American people do not want to spend billions of dollars on a wall which Trump told us would be paid for by Mexico. They want to protect Dreamers and working families.
2372,Sanders,It's not just Democrats and Independents. More Republicans support allowing Dreamers to stay in the country than support building a wall. It couldn't be clearer what Congress needs to do.
2373,Sanders,"Instead of Attorney General Sessions intensifying the failed war on drugs, states should be allowed to make their own decisions regarding the legalization or decriminalization of marijuana."
2374,Sanders,"I'm not sure why President Trump wants to shut down the government over an $18 billion wall that no one wants, isn't needed and Mexico won't pay for. What the American people want, overwhelmingly, is to provide legal protection and a path toward citizenship for 800,000 Dreamers."
2375,Sanders,"This is a health crisis that no one is talking about it. If Congress does not act soon to fund the Community Health Center program, 2,800 health centers will close their doors."
2376,Sanders,"When history looks back on this period, I do not want people to see a U.S. Congress which worked overtime to protect billionaires and large corporations but turned its back on providing health care to vulnerable children."
2377,Sanders,"Mr. Trump, listen to these Patriotic Millionaires who want their taxes raised, not cut."
2378,Sanders,Leader McConnell‚Äôs statement is very disturbing and misleading. He conveniently ignores the fact that mandatory spending on domestic programs have been severely cut and that the Defense Department has received tens of billions in OCO funding that isn't capped at all.
2379,Sanders,The U.S. Congress has got to do more than increase military spending and give tax breaks to billionaires. We are here to protect working families.
2380,Sanders,"When Republicans want to add some $100 billion to military spending over the next two years we will not turn our backs on working families, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. We must have parity between defense and non-defense spending."
2381,Sanders,"I am very disappointed that the Republican Party, which controls the White House, the House and the Senate, is pushing us closer and closer to a very dangerous government shutdown. They must not allow that. They have got to compromise."
2382,Sanders,Watch live here:
2383,Sanders,"I will be speaking on the Senate floor at 12:30 PM about the budget negotiations. I'm very disappointed that the Republican Party, which controls the White House, Senate and House, is pushing us closer and closer to a very dangerous government shutdown."
2384,Sanders,"No, Attorney General Sessions. Marijuana is not the same as heroin. No one who has seriously studied the issue believes that. Quite the contrary. We should allow states the right to move toward the decriminalization of marijuana, not reverse the progress that has been made."
2385,Sanders,"Iceland just became the first country in the world to make it illegal to pay men more than women. In the United States in 2016, black women made 62.5 cents on the dollar compared to white men and hispanic women made 54.4 cents. That is a disgrace."
2386,Sanders,"During his campaign, Trump said over and over again that he would stick it to the wealthy by closing the egregious carried interest loophole. Guess what? His disgraceful tax bill did nothing to address it and even Fox Business commentators are fed up with his broken promises."
2387,Sanders,This is a simple matter of priorities. With $1.5 trillion we could eliminate child poverty in America two times over. What did Trump and Republicans in Congress choose to do? Give permanent tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations.
2388,Sanders,Don't be fooled by Trump when he talks about boosts to the stock market from his tax plan. That money is going to the wealthy and large corporations.
2389,Sanders,"Watch Canadian doctor @docdanielle respond to the pathetic myth that single-payer health care is a ""Big Brother-style"" government takeover:"
2390,Sanders,"Here is a New Year's Resolution I hope you will share with me. In 2018, we will not only intensify the struggle against Trumpism, we will increase our efforts to spread the progressive vision in every corner of the land."
2391,Sanders,It is the right of all people to speak out against their government. The government of Iran should respect this right and heed the voices of thousands of Iranians who are demonstrating across the country for better opportunities and a better future.
2392,Sanders,"If Congress does not get its act together, we're going to have 800,000 bright young people with no legal status who will be subject to deportation and thrown out of the only country they have ever known. We must protect the DREAMers and move them towards citizenship."
2393,Sanders,"It is astounding that we have a president who celebrates 13 million people losing their health insurance. Instead of bragging about more Americans without health care, we should be joining the rest of the industrialized world and guaranteeing health care to all people as a right."
2394,Sanders,"The United States is virtually the only country on earth that allows pharmaceutical companies to jack up the price of a life-saving cancer drug by 1,400%. This is an outrage."
2395,Sanders,The Republicans are so desperate to spin their disastrous tax plan that they have resorted to taking comments I recently made completely out of context. Let me set the record straight.
2396,Sanders,"My thoughts are with Erica Garner, her family and friends in hoping that she has a full recovery and rejoins the struggle for justice as soon as possible. I have had the privilege of joining with her at a number of events and was deeply impressed with her courage and insights."
2397,Sanders,What we could do with $1.5 trillion:-Make college tuition-free-Provide universal preschool-Repair our crumbling infrastructure-Fund CHIP for 107 years-Rebuild Puerto RicoWhat Republicans did:-Give tax breaks to the wealthy and
2398,Sanders,At least Trump is finally telling the truth about his tax bill.
2399,Sanders,"I am a big ""no"" vote on the continuing resolution because it is unconscionable for Congress to go on break when there are so many enormous problems facing the country that need our attention right now."
2400,Sanders,Congress needs to get its act together and pass funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Health care for 9 million children is at stake. 9 million children.
2401,Sanders,"Doesn‚Äôt it tell us a lot about Republican priorities when the tax breaks for corporations are permanent, while the tax breaks for working families expire at the end of 8 years?"
2402,Sanders,"I received hundreds of questions from Snapchatters all over the country, from how this Republican tax bill will impact your life to my favorite flavor of Ben &amp; Jerry's. Got to the Discover tab on Snapchat and add me as a friend (bernie.sanders) to watch."
2403,Sanders,Workers in America have earned their retirement benefits from a lifetime of hard work. We cannot allow Paul Ryan to destroy these programs.
2404,Sanders,"It would be unconscionable to leave Washington after giving tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, while we ignore the enormous problems facing working families. https://t.co/9PaVTLQL2J"
2405,Sanders,"Republicans are celebrating raising taxes on working families to give tax breaks to billionaires, corporations, private jet owners and themselves. Remember that."
2406,Sanders,"Republicans have not even signed their tax cuts for billionaires into law and they are already promising to make cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security."
2407,Sanders,Senate Republicans just passed their tax reform bill. What an utter disgrace.
2408,Sanders,Republicans have to change the name of their tax bill because it violates Senate rules. What should we call it now?
2409,Sanders,"Americans ‚Äì Democrats, Republicans and Independents ‚Äì say that we must protect Dreamers. Congress must not adjourn until we have a fix."
2410,Sanders,"@SpeakerRyan Paul Ryan has been dreaming of cutting benefits for working families since he was ""drinking at a keg."" That's not something to be proud of."
2411,Sanders,"What we are seeing today, in an unprecedented way, is the looting of the federal Treasury. https://t.co/G0XjvfNwC9"
2412,Sanders,"In the mad dash to provide tax breaks for their billionaire campaign contributors, my Republican colleagues forgot to comply with the rules of the Senate."
2413,Sanders,"House Republicans just passed their disastrous tax bill. Congratulations to the Koch brothers, massive corporations and billionaire campaign contributors on looting the Treasury and working families."
2414,Sanders,Republican members of Congress are rushing to pass a bill that will increase their own personal wealth at the expense of the middle class.
2415,Sanders,"After crashing the world economy and costing millions of Americans their jobs, Citigroup &amp; Goldman Sachs took $3.7 trillion in taxpayer bailouts. Now, the GOP is giving them a $15.2 billion tax break."
2416,Sanders,Exxon Mobil is getting a great return on their investment in the Republican Party. It will receive a $10.5 billion tax break after donating $16.8 million to Republicans since 1990.
2417,Sanders,"Johnson &amp; Johnson will get a $12.9 billion tax break to ""create jobs."" Last time it repatriated offshore profits, the company fired people and gave executives a $32.8 million raise."
2418,Sanders,"IBM fired 12,000 workers and gave executives a $7 million raise after bringing $9.5 billion back into the US in 2004, yet Republicans want to give the company a $13.9 billion tax cut."
2419,Sanders,"Between 2008 and 2015, General Electric received more in tax credits than it paid in actual taxes and is still in line for a $16 billion tax cut next year."
2420,Sanders,Microsoft will receive $27.7 billion in tax cuts after donating $17.9 million to the Republican Party since 1990.
2421,Sanders,"Pfizer, which fired thousands of employees and gave executives huge raises after the last repatriation holiday, will get a $38.8 billion tax break."
2422,Sanders,"Apple, which has received $726 million in corporate welfare and government handouts over the last 30 years, will get a $48 billion tax cut from Republicans."
2423,Sanders,"Today is a victory for the largest and most profitable corporations in this country who, despite record-breaking profits, will now see hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks at the expense of working families."
2424,Sanders,"At a time of massive inequality, the Republican tax bill will unbelievably provide 83% of the benefits to the top 1%, while increasing taxes on 92 million middle-class households by the end of the decade."
2425,Sanders,It is a disgrace that Republicans are rushing to pass a massive tax break for the wealthy while children are about to be thrown off their health insurance.
2426,Sanders,"I won't vote for any spending bill if we do not pass a Dream Act and guarantee that the 800,000 beautiful DREAMers in America are allowed to stay in the only country they know as home."
2427,Sanders,"This is a tax bill written for massive corporations and wealthy Republican campaign contributors, not for the average American. It must be defeated."
2428,Sanders,"In case there are any misconceptions about who this ""middle class tax reform"" bill is really for."
2429,Sanders,"Republicans in Congress want to spend this last week before the government funding deadline trying to pass tax breaks for the rich. What if, instead, we actually addressed the crises affecting working people?"
2430,Sanders,Goldman Sachs alone will get a $6 billion tax break from the Republican tax bill. That is a disgrace. https://t.co/0hOr2aGDzu
2431,Sanders,"Another reminder that as soon as Republicans pass their massive tax cut for the wealthy and large corporations ‚Äì running up a $1.4 trillion deficit ‚Äì they will turn around and say we must cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."
2432,Sanders,Need further proof that the Republican tax bill is a massive giveaway to the largest corporations? The Republican tax bill hands 15 corporations a $236 billion tax break.
2433,Sanders,"We must act now to prevent 800,000 Dreamers, young people who were raised in this country, from losing their legal status. Any end of year spending agreement must address the fear unnecessarily caused by Trump's reckless actions, and a clean Dream Act must be signed into law."
2434,Sanders,Congress must not break for recess unless it addresses some of the major crises facing this country.
2435,Sanders,"People like @AdyBarkan are what this fight against the #GOPTaxScam are all about. We can defeat this horrific piece of legislation, but only if everyone stands up and fights back."
2436,Sanders,This tax bill is a moral and economic obscenity. It is a gift to wealthy Republican campaign contributors and an insult to the working families of our country. No member of Congress should vote for this disastrous legislation.
2437,Sanders,Spread the word: today is the LAST DAY of open enrollment to sign up for health insurance. Go to https://t.co/GjiTq2lZbz to choose a plan and get covered.
2438,Sanders,"‚ÄúThe proposed tax reform package stakes out America‚Äôs bid to become the most unequal society in the world."" ‚Äì @Alston_UNSR"
2439,Sanders,"Our job: Fight back against the reactionary Trump agenda and for a progressive agenda that works for the middle class, not the 1%."
2440,Sanders,"He promised to lower the cost of prescription drugs but then nominated Alex Azar, a former pharmaceutical industry executive, as head of the Health and Human Services agency."
2441,Sanders,"He promised to stand up to the power of corporate interests, but supported the FCC decision to end net neutrality, something Comcast, AT&amp;T and other media conglomerates were begging for."
2442,Sanders,"He promised to pass tax reform that would benefit the middle class, but is now supporting legislation that gives 62% of the benefits to the top 1% and would, after 10 years, raise taxes on 83 million middle-class families."
2443,Sanders,"He promised to provide health care to ""everybody,"" but he supported legislation that would have thrown up to 32 million Americans off the health care they currently have."
2444,Sanders,"As we come toward the end of 2017, I hope and expect that most Americans know that almost every promise that @realDonaldTrump made during his presidential campaign was a lie. Just a few examples:"
2445,Sanders,"The Republican tax bill is a hole-in-one for Trump himself, who will benefit from tax breaks for real estate investors and golf course owners. This is a disgrace."
2446,Sanders,This is the end of the internet as we know it. In Congress and in the courts we must fight back. #NetNeutrality
2447,Sanders,The FCC just voted to repeal #NetNeutrality. We must do everything we can to stop this egregious decision from taking effect.
2448,Sanders,"This is an egregious attack on our democracy. The end of #NetNeutrality protections means that the internet will be for sale to the highest bidder. When our democratic institutions are already in peril, we must do everything we can to stop this decision from taking effect."
2449,Sanders,"At this moment when our democratic institutions are in peril, ending #NetNeutrality protections would be devastating. The FCC must vote against ending a free and open internet."
2450,Sanders,"If you really think that Verizon, Comcast, AT&amp;T and Time Warner need more money, then you should be for repealing #NetNeutrality. - @RepRoKhanna"
2451,Sanders,"There has not been one public hearing, no opportunity to hear from economists, governors, mayors or ordinary Americans who will be impacted by this tax bill. This is a sham."
2452,Sanders,This tax bill was written for Republicans‚Äô wealthy campaign contributors. I want to congratulate my Republican colleagues for their honesty about that.
2453,Sanders,This is not a real conference committee. It is a sham. This tax legislation has already been written behind closed doors.https://t.co/3kCt8ZQ7V8
2454,Sanders,"If the president is serious about fixing NAFTA, he must protect the interests of American workers‚Äînot the CEOs of multi-national corporations who have rigged our trade policies for the past 40 years."
2455,Sanders,"As we speak, the re-negotiation of NAFTA is being done behind closed doors with 500 corporate lobbyists and executives who are working overtime to protect their interests at the expense of working people."
2456,Sanders,The Republican tax plan sticks it to working families and makes it harder for students to pay for college. Here's how:
2457,Sanders,It looks like the president‚Äôs promises to help working people were just another lie. Trump is already moving to destroy safety net programs that millions of people rely on.
2458,Sanders,It‚Äôs bad enough that the Koch brothers are able to spend unlimited amounts to buy politicians as a result of Citizens United. But to allow them to deduct the dark money they spend to influence the political process is beyond absurd.
2459,Sanders,"Mr. Trump, watch these Patriotic Millionaires explain how to stimulate the economy. It's not by giving massive tax breaks to your billionaire friends."
2460,Sanders,"Republicans cannot ignore millions of older workers who are about to lose the pensions they were promised, younger people burdened with outrageous levels of student debt or veterans unable to get the quality health care they were promised."
2461,Sanders,"Republicans cannot ignore the reality that 800,000 Dreamers will start losing their legal status in a few months."
2462,Sanders,"Republicans cannot ask for $54 billion more in military spending, and ignore the health care needs of our children and working families in the CHIP and Community Health Center programs."
2463,Sanders,"The Republicans, who control the Senate, House and White House, must not be allowed to shut down the government. They must work in a bipartisan way to pass a budget which reflects the needs of all Americans, not just wealthy campaign contributors."
2464,Sanders,Buried in the Republican tax plan are hidden provisions designed to stick it to the poor and working class while the rich and corporations get billions of dollars in breaks.
2465,Sanders,A disaster. A joke. A lie. Here's how these millionaires describe the fraudulent trickle-down economic theory:
2466,Sanders,"As a member of the tax conference committee, I will do everything I can to defeat this bill. We need to rebuild the disappearing middle class, not provide more tax breaks to billionaires."
2467,Sanders,Corporate America doesn't want to reduce their tax rate down to 20 percent. They want it down to zero. And that's a burden that will fall on the backs of the middle class.
2468,Sanders,"Republican plan:1. Run up the deficit with tax breaks for the wealthy2. Freak out about the deficit3. Cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to bring down the deficit"
2469,Sanders,We have a president who acknowledged on tape that he assaulted women. I would hope that he pays attention to what's going on and think about resigning.
2470,Sanders,We need a revolution in the way women are treated in this country.
2471,Sanders,".@realDonaldTrump Was this a lie? Do you intend to go along with Paul Ryan's plan to cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, or will you keep your promises to the American people?"
2472,Sanders,"There it is. Paul Ryan just admitted that after providing $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top 1% and large corporations, Republicans will try to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and help for the most vulnerable Americans."
2473,Sanders,"It needs to be an ongoing movement of women and men that includes a national discussion about sexism, sexual harassment, objectification, inequality and abuse of power."
2474,Sanders,"We are finally addressing the issue of sexual harassment, and we need to get it right. But the conversation we are having now is only the tip of the iceberg."
2475,Sanders,We are now at a crossroads in American culture. And it is an important one. The way we treat women in our country has been abysmal in almost every way.
2476,Sanders,Sen. Franken has said that he will be making an announcement about his political future tomorrow. The right thing is for him to resign.
2477,Sanders,Join me @SenWarren to talk about where we go from here in the fight against the Republican tax bill and what our priorities should really be.https://t.co/GkQ7cOWBTw
2478,Sanders,"More than 6,000 lobbyists worked on the Republican tax bill - that's more than half of the lobbyists in DC. No wonder it's a gift to giant corporations."
2479,Sanders,"There‚Äôs a reason why all past US administrations have not made this move, and why leaders around the world have warned Trump against it: It would undermine the prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement and severely, perhaps irreparably, damage our ability to broker it."
2480,Sanders,Our health system isn't designed to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way. It's designed to provide huge profits to insurance and drug companies and exorbitant compensation packages to
2481,Sanders,.@RandPaull thinks having the right to health care means you believe in slavery. Here's how Canadian @DocDanielle responded to that theory:
2482,Sanders,Keep. Your. Word.
2483,Sanders,"Unbelievable but true: Republicans in Congress want tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires at the same time that they want to cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security for struggling seniors."
2484,Sanders,I've got a challenge for Mr. Trump: Keep your damn promises.https://t.co/Iao08E3JJl
2485,Sanders,".@realDonaldTrump, I have a challenge for you:"
2486,Sanders,"Mr. President, keep your promises. Today, get on the phone. Tell Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell that you will veto any bill that cuts Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."
2487,Sanders,"The bottom line is: Americans do not want us to pass tax breaks for billionaires and they certainly don‚Äôt want us to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.https://t.co/7RYx7ZAc1D"
2488,Sanders,The wealthy and the powerful want you to think you are powerless. But we know that that's not the truth.https://t.co/vq31WuKlKb
2489,Sanders,Congressional Republicans and President Trump are waging class warfare. We are going to stand up and fight back! #TaxScamBill
2490,Sanders,"Last night, trillions of dollars were stolen from the American people. Well, I have news for @SenateMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan: You are not going to get away with it. #TaxScamBill"
2491,Sanders,The fight against the tax bill is not over. We need to stand together to protect working families. https://t.co/fSZm2Pj6Cg
2492,Sanders,"Last night, Senate Republicans passed their disastrous tax bill, but this fight is not over. I‚Äôll be in Dayton, Ohio, shortly to rally the American people against this travesty."
2493,Sanders,"I say to my Republican colleagues: The American people are catching on. While you may get away with this act of looting tonight, history is not on your side."
2494,Sanders,"Our extreme poverty rate is so high that it is an international concern. Why on earth are Republicans are trying to push through a $1.5 trillion tax cut for the very wealthiest, while 41 million Americans are living in poverty? This is a disgrace."
2495,Sanders,Someone alert the authorities: Senate Republicans are looting the Treasury. I‚Äôm live now speaking about the Republican tax bill:
2496,Sanders,"Historians will look back on Dec. 1, 2017 and conclude this was one of the great robberies in US history because Republicans are looting the Treasury."
2497,Sanders,Ronald Reagan tried it. George W. Bush tried it. Guess what? Cutting taxes for the wealthy doesn't work.
2498,Sanders,"Follow me on Snapchat as we take on the GOP Tax Scam in Kentucky, Ohio and Pennsylvania this weekend."
2499,Sanders,A vote for the Republican tax bill is a vote to take health insurance away from millions of Americans.
2500,Sanders,"During the campaign, Trump promised to protect Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Now Congressional Republicans are getting ready to cut them."
2501,Sanders,What bill? We still haven't seen what we're voting on.
2502,Sanders,"Mark my words: As soon as the Republican tax bill passes, Republicans are going to insist on cutting Medicare and Social Security to cut the deficit. We cannot let this disastrous bill pass."
2503,Sanders,"Maybe I missed it, but I don't remember the need to provide tax breaks to wealthy hedge fund managers in the Virgin Islands being one of our nation's pressing crises. Yet that's exactly what Section 14504 of the GOP bill does."
2504,Sanders,"There it is! My Republican friend from Pennsylvania finally admitted it last night. After the tax bill passes, they are going to come back to cut your Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. They must be defeated."
2505,Sanders,"We‚Äôve seen this movie before. It was a bad movie. The last time Congress enacted a corporate tax holiday on overseas profits in 2004, the top 15 beneficiaries cut 21,000 U.S. jobs."
2506,Sanders,Today Senator Rubio tried to tell me he wouldn't cut Medicare or Social Security. That's not what he said yesterday morning.
2507,Sanders,"Tonight I asked my Republican colleague Sen. Toomey to guarantee to the American people there would not be cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid after this tax bill. He couldn't do that."
2508,Sanders,"Trickle-down economics failed under Ronald Reagan, under George W. Bush and in the state of Kansas under Gov. Brownback. It is a fraudulent theory cooked up by think tanks funded by the wealthy."
2509,Sanders,"When Reagan slashed taxes for the rich in 1981, economic growth went down by 1.9% the following year and the unemployment rate increased. The 1981 tax cut was so ""successful"" that Reagan had to increase taxes 11 times after that."
2510,Sanders,"The bottom line: the American people do not want us to pass tax breaks for billionaires today and they certainly don‚Äôt want us to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.https://t.co/bqrpaQTATx"
2511,Sanders,"I will be listening eagerly for any Republican to tell me they will not come back from increasing the deficit $1.4 trillion with cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security."
2512,Sanders,"I know that Trump is not much into history or the U.S. Constitution, but he ought to know that millions of men and women have struggled, fought and died to defend our democracy and the religious freedom that our Constitution guarantees."
2513,Sanders,"I don't make it a habit to respond to every ugly tweet from President Trump. If I did, I‚Äôd have little time for anything else. But even for Trump, today's retweets of a series of offensive videos from a British right-wing, anti-Muslim fringe group reaches a new low."
2514,Sanders,Has corporate media paid enough attention to the issues affecting everyday Americans? Tune in to the discussion: https://t.co/VxFo9ZPYbb
2515,Sanders,"What is the future of digital media? Senator Sanders talks with journalists from @nowthisnews, @TheYoungTurks, @ajplus and @attn:https://t.co/VxFo9ZPYbb"
2516,Sanders,Starting soon: Facebook Live conversation on the state of politics and digital media. Watch at https://t.co/TIdQMUk3ML
2517,Sanders,"If Republicans will not come back from passing a $1.4 trillion deficit increase with cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and other programs‚Äîcome down to the floor of the United States Senate and tell me that I‚Äôm wrong."
2518,Sanders,Join me today at 4:45 ET for a Facebook live conversation with journalists from four leading social media news outlets about the state of politics and digital media. https://t.co/TIdQMUk3ML
2519,Sanders,What ‚Äúentitlement reform‚Äù actually means is massive cuts to Social Security at a time when millions of older workers have nothing in the bank for their retirement.
2520,Sanders,"It is without doubt that as soon as this tax legislation is passed, Republicans will rediscover their religion about the deficit and say we need ‚Äúentitlement reform.‚Äù"
2521,Sanders,"Pathetic, disgraceful, immoral. How else can I describe the Republican tax plan? It must be stopped.https://t.co/9whBKb7TTr"
2522,Sanders,Thank you to those who showed up to the Senate yesterday to protest the horrific Republican tax bill. I hope my colleagues are listening.
2523,Sanders,"Tim Scott says he wants hardworking, everyday Americans to get ahead. So I hope he will vote against the disastrous GOP tax bill. #TaxDebate"
2524,Sanders,The GOP tax bill must be defeated. We should then sit down and develop tax policy that actually works for working families. #TaxDebate
2525,Sanders,We live in a moment in history where we have more income and wealth inequality than any time since the 1920s. The idea that 60% of the benefits in the Republican tax plan go to the top 1% is beyond absurd. #TaxDebate
2526,Sanders,"Ted, tell the truth. Your plan raises taxes on 87 million middle class households to give tax cuts to the wealthy and large corporations. #TaxDebate"
2527,Sanders,Ted Cruz and Tim Scott should listen to these Patriotic Millionaires instead of their campaign contributors. #TaxDebate
2528,Sanders,He took out the essence.
2529,Sanders,"Billionaires make their campaign contributions and we have politicians who work for them, not the middle class. #TaxDebate"
2530,Sanders,Republicans love talking about Reagan's major tax cut in 1981. They fail to mention he raised taxes 10 times thereafter. #TaxDebate
2531,Sanders,"Tim Scott and Ted Cruz love to say the GOP tax plan is about creating jobs, that's nonsense. #TaxDebate"
2532,Sanders,Then why are you supporting a bill that would raise taxes on 87 million middle class households? #TaxDebate
2533,Sanders,"37 of 38 experts agreed that the Republican tax bills would cause U.S. debt to increase ""substantially"" faster than the economy. The 38th said he misread the question."
2534,Sanders,Repealing the estate tax will give hundreds of billion of dollars to the wealthiest people in this country. #TaxDebate
2535,Sanders,"Republicans want to repeal the estate tax, which applies only to the top 0.2 percent. That's a disgrace. #TaxDebate"
2536,Sanders,I‚Äôm for a tax break for small businesses and for working families all over this country. What I am not for is enormous tax breaks for billionaires. #TaxDebate
2537,Sanders,Here's something I wish Tim Scott and Ted Cruz would understand: Corporate tax cuts don't create jobs. #TaxDebate
2538,Sanders,Ted Cruz keeps saying we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world. That is false. #TaxDebate
2539,Sanders,"The top 0.1% of Americans are already doing pretty well. But Republicans say they need even more. So they're giving them an average break of $208,000. Unbelievable. #TaxDebate"
2540,Sanders,"FACT: Under the Republican plan, a single mother making minimum wage with two kids would get only a $75 tax credit. Meanwhile, a family making $500k with two kids would get a $4,000 tax credit. #TaxDebate"
2541,Sanders,Let's get the facts straight: 62% of the benefits in the Senate Republican tax plan go to the top 1% and 40% of the benefits go to the top 0.1% by the end of the decade. #TaxDebate
2542,Sanders,Who in their right mind believes now is the time to give massive tax breaks to billionaires? #TaxDebate
2543,Sanders,"According to the Tax Policy Center, 87 million middle class households would see their taxes go up by the end of the decade under the Republican tax bill. #CNNDebateNight"
2544,Sanders,"Tune in to CNN tonight at 9 ET, when @SenatorCantwell and I will debate @SenTedCruz and @SenatorTimScott on the Republican ""tax reform‚Äù plan. #CNNDebateNight"
2545,Sanders,"@GOPSenFinance @SenatorEnzi @BudgetGOP ""Hats off"" to Senate Republicans for advancing their tax scam. #KillTheBill"
2546,Sanders,Every Republican except the chairman has left the budget hearing on the tax bill. Why are they afraid to defend their plan to raise taxes on 87 million middle class households?
2547,Sanders,How is it a tax reform plan for the middle class if 87 million middle class households will see their taxes go up?
2548,Sanders,We took some American doctors to Canada to see a universal health care system up close. Here's what they learned:
2549,Sanders,"It would be absurd to rebuild Puerto Rico‚Äôs antiquated, fossil fuel-dependent grid back the way it was. We must take advantage of the abundant sustainable energy they have."
2550,Sanders,"The people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are not forgotten, they are not alone, and we will do everything possible to rebuild those beautiful islands."
2551,Sanders,It makes no sense to simply put things back the way they were in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. We have to help the islands build back stronger. https://t.co/CCPXyND7En
2552,Sanders,".@SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr, how much will you cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security to pay for a $1.4 trillion deficit increase? How much will you cut Pell Grants, WIC and Head Start? The people have a right to know."
2553,Sanders,"Today and every day, our workers deserve $15 an hour, decent working conditions and the right to form a union. #BlackFriday"
2554,Sanders,The U.S. and other developed countries must develop policies to improve life for the desperately poor around the world. We should not be making a bad situation even worse.
2555,Sanders,"I wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving. This has been a tough year, but we can move forward in a direction based on generosity and love."
2556,Sanders,"If the tax plan is passed, giving huge breaks to the 1% and raising the deficit $1.5 trillion, Republican leaders will rediscover ""the deficit crisis"" and move aggressively to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."
2557,Sanders,The Republican tax bill would be a major step forward in creating the kind of oligarchy long envisioned by the Koch brothers and other powerful right wing extremists.
2558,Sanders,Why are big CEOs trying to convince the American people that trickle-down economics works? We already know that it doesn't.
2559,Sanders,"Trump's sanctuary cities policy is federal coercion to enforce the president‚Äôs racist, anti-immigrant policies. This is a check on an out-of-control executive branch and a victory for the rule of law."
2560,Sanders,"Once again, the Trump administration sides with big money and against democracy. If this passes, the internet and its free exchange of information as we have come to know it will cease to exist. #NetNeutrality"
2561,Sanders,Republicans' tax bill would throw 13 million Americans off of health insurance. Here's how:
2562,Sanders,Ridiculous. The idea of ‚Äúclean coal‚Äù is pure fiction. It's a concept intended to keep us tied to fossil fuels when we should be embracing sustainable sources of energy.
2563,Sanders,Yesterday my colleagues and I sent a letter to Sec. Tillerson asking him to make it easier to send U.S. aid for Iranian earthquake relief. The U.S. has routinely offered to help the Iranian people in times of need. This time should be no different.
2564,Sanders,"While we do not need more evidence to show us that pipelines are dangerous and must be stopped, more keeps coming."
2565,Sanders,"There already is far too much media concentration in this country. We need more diversity, more local ownership, more viewpoints. @AjitPaiFCC's decision is a massive step backwards."
2566,Sanders,"If we are going to stop Republicans from taking health care from millions and slashing Medicare to give tax cuts to the wealthy and large corporations, NOW is the time to stand up and fight back."
2567,Sanders,"Paul Ryan has been fantasizing about cutting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security for years. Ryan's plan must be defeated."
2568,Sanders,We shouldn't throw 13 million people off of health insurance to give more money to billionaires and corporations. I can't believe we even have to say that.
2569,Sanders,"Two months after Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are still living in misery. As a nation we must do better."
2570,Sanders,"Just like we defeated Republicans' efforts to repeal Obamacare, we need to stop their tax plan. Join me and @MoveOn tonight at 8 ET at https://t.co/7MdXIJpM7O to get ready to fight back."
2571,Sanders,Our fight against the Republican tax plan requires the same urgency as when they tried to repeal Obamacare. Health care for 13 million Americans is at stake.
2572,Sanders,Watch @docdanielle debunk one of Fox News' most pathetic single payer myths:
2573,Sanders,"Renewable energy, like wind and solar, are the kinds of projects the federal government should be focused on‚Äînot more drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. #ProtectTheArctic"
2574,Sanders,It is insane to open up a National Wildlife Refuge to provide more handouts to wealthy fossil fuel corporations. #ProtectTheArctic
2575,Sanders,"The future for our country and planet is in renewable energy, not fossil fuel. #ProtectTheArctic"
2576,Sanders,"Years from now people will ask, ‚ÄúWhat world was the Senate living in when they considered drilling for oil in Alaska, while climate change was causing devastating damage?"""
2577,Sanders,How many times do we have to defeat Republicans' efforts to take health insurance away from millions to give tax breaks to the top 1%? Apparently once more.
2578,Sanders,"Thank you, Gary Cohn, for that lesson in why trickle-down economics is a fraud and failure."
2579,Sanders,A vote for the Republican tax bill is a vote to cut Medicare by $400 billion over the next decade.
2580,Sanders,We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. How is it possible that 2 months after Hurricane Maria half the people of Puerto Rico don't have electricity?
2581,Sanders,For the last 18 years @GunnelsWarren has been by my side watching Republicans try to destroy the middle class.
2582,Sanders,"The Paradise Papers make clear that we need, in the United States and throughout the world, a tax system which is fair, progressive and transparent."
2583,Sanders,"Trump was clearly never serious about his promise to lower drug prices. We need an HHS secretary who will take on the drug industry's greed, not someone who has financially benefitted from it."
2584,Sanders,"The essence of oligarchy is that the billionaire class is never satisfied with what they have. They want more, no matter what impact their efforts have on working people."
2585,Sanders,"Well, at least Trump is consistent. Abroad, he has never met a leader of an authoritarian nation (Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Philippines) that he hasn't liked. At home he shows contempt for the U.S. Constitution and democracy."
2586,Sanders,"America‚Äôs role as a global leader should be to find ways to de-escalate tensions and work with allies to find diplomatic solutions, not to support increased conflict between regional powers."
2587,Sanders,Trump's chief economic advisor finally admitted what we already knew: big CEOs are getting incredible benefits form the Republican tax plan.
2588,Sanders,"While we set aside this day to recognize our veterans, we must commit ourselves to keep America‚Äôs promise to them every day. #VeteransDay"
2589,Sanders,"My Republican colleagues love to say the U.S. has the best health care in the world. Well, these Canadians think otherwise and so do I."
2590,Sanders,"American billionaires love the military and they love schools, but they don't want to pay anything to maintain those institutions."
2591,Sanders,"I‚Äôm no historian, but I think it‚Äôs fair to say that there‚Äôs probably never been a president less qualified than"
2592,Sanders,"If that were the case, I can assure you the Koch brothers, Trump and other billionaires would not be pushing so hard for this plan."
2593,Sanders,It's nice to see Republicans in Congress looking out for the people who really matter: their wealthy donors.
2594,Sanders,"Corporate tax loopholes have become so absurd that one five-story building in the Cayman Islands is ‚Äúhome‚Äù to nearly 20,000 corporations."
2595,Sanders,LIVE: We recently found out a terrible truth about the rapid movement toward global oligarchy. #ParadisePapers https://t.co/a22wk9yKIf
2596,Sanders,Canadians tell Americans the truth about health care wait times in Canada:
2597,Sanders,"Two sisters both had breast cancer. The one in Canada focused on getting better, while her sister in America faced mounting medical bills."
2598,Sanders,"Congress must act now or 2,800 community health centers will close and millions will lose access to health care."
2599,Sanders,Watch @docdanielle debunk the myth that Canadians have their health care decisions decided by the government.
2600,Sanders,"Today at the international climate talks, Syria joined the Paris Climate Agreement. Thanks to Trump, the U.S. is now the only one out."
2601,Sanders,There's no good reason why Americans should feel they have to leave our country in order to receive affordable medical care.
2602,Sanders,Our pattern of doing nothing after mass shootings must end. Gun violence in America is a major crisis which must be addressed.
2603,Sanders,"The time is long, long past for us to put the lives of children and innocent Americans over the interests of the NRA‚Äôs corporate backers."
2604,Sanders,How many tragedies must we witness before Republicans in Congress agree to pass legislation to end this epidemic of senseless slaughter?
2605,Sanders,"The key issue of our time is the movement toward oligarchy, where a few billionaires control much of the economy."
2606,Sanders,".@keithellison breaks down why Trump's tax plan means more yachts, homes and political influence for the wealthiest people in this country."
2607,Sanders,Before Congress considers a tax bill it must investigate the Paradise Papers. We must end the rapid movement toward international oligarchy.
