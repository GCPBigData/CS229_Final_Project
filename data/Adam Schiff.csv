1833,Adam Schiff,".@RepMikePompeo accepts conclusions of IC on Russia hack, pledges to continue robust collection on Russia. He must speak truth to power."
1834,Adam Schiff,We will hold @RepMikePompeo to his pledge to adhere to Army Field Manual. There is no question that torture is unconstitutional and immoral.
1835,Adam Schiff,Good opening statement by CIA Nominee @RepMikePompeo. Acknowledged CIA role is apolitical &amp; we must set politics aside. We all count on it.

1841,Adam Schiff,.@realDonaldTrump comparing the Intelligence Community to Nazi Germany. A new low. These men and woman who serve our country are PATRIOTS!
1842,Adam Schiff,"No, @realDonaldTrump, you have conflict of interest problem. It's called the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. Release your tax returns"

1844,Adam Schiff,Questions for Rex Tillerson: Will you stand up to Putin? Will you champion sanctions even when they hurt the interests of your oil company?
1845,Adam Schiff,Rex Tillerson was given special friendship medal from Kremlin &amp; spent entire career at company with interests often at odds with our nation.
1846,Adam Schiff,"No, thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. #ThanksObama"

1862,Adam Schiff,I grieve for lives lost in yesterday's attack in Jerusalem. We will work with our ally Israel to strengthen security and defeat terrorism.
1863,Adam Schiff,Know what's more serious @realDonaldTrump? You're outraged about everything BUT Russia hacking our elections.
1864,Adam Schiff,.@realDonaldTrump needs to realize: No one is doing more right now to call into question the legitimacy of a Trump presidency than he is.
1865,Adam Schiff,"The Russian hack is not just about your election, but attack on all liberal democracies. D's and R's need to work on comprehensive response."
1866,Adam Schiff,"Here's the point: the Russians did hack and meddle. And we need you to accept that, @realDonaldTrump, so we can do something about it."
1867,Adam Schiff,Whether it had decisive impact we will never know. Not intelligence community's job to try &amp; guess. Their job is to tell what happened &amp; why

1870,Adam Schiff,Thinking of the families of victims and those injured in the Ft. Lauderdale airport shooting. Absolutely horrifying.
1871,Adam Schiff,"Trump's statement Russian hacking had ""absolutely no effect on outcome of the election"" is not supported by briefing, report or common sense"
1872,Adam Schiff,... but was also motivated by the desire to help Donald Trump’s election chances by discrediting Secretary Hillary Clinton.

1880,Adam Schiff,Your job isn't spokesman for an organization and man who put American lives at risk. #ActLikeAPresident
1881,Adam Schiff,Promise kept: @realDonaldTrump finally revealed what he knows about Russian hacking that others don't. Not a thing.
1882,Adam Schiff,".@CoryBooker thanks for the treats, and showing me that being vegan doesn't mean you always have to be healthy!"
1883,Adam Schiff,That Trump would accept self-serving denials of Kremlin is alarming enough. Citing Assange takes him into new &amp; more treacherous territory.
1884,Adam Schiff,"When Trump belittles the Intelligence Community, he impairs our national security and prospects for the success of his own Administration."
1885,Adam Schiff,"With every conspiracy theory-laden tweet Trump does damage to national security, while raising concerns about his capacity to grow into job."

1918,Adam Schiff,The only way out of this box is to fully divest. Trump has said he doesn’t care about his business interests anymore. Time to prove it.
1919,Adam Schiff,Turning day to day management over to children doesn't solve problem. “Princelings” are a feature of many kleptocracies around the world.
1920,Adam Schiff,Imagine if Trump's gratitude or anger bleeds out – muddying America's foreign policy in ways that elude accountability.
1921,Adam Schiff,What if a country pays fair market price to stay in a Trump hotel? Not good enough. The Clause prohibits payment even for services rendered.
1922,Adam Schiff,"They'll assume it's advantageous to promote a Trump organization, stay at Trump hotels or eliminate hurdles to Trump developments."
1923,Adam Schiff,"Foreign states will tread carefully around Trump’s private interests, hoping to avoid his wrath and curry favor. We've seen this already."
1924,Adam Schiff,"Given Trump’s lack of transparency on taxes and business interests, many of these potential conflicts will be hidden from public."
1925,Adam Schiff,Trump’s very attached to his businesses. Easy to imagine he'll be affected by his own perceptions of how countries deal with his company.
1926,Adam Schiff,"There’s no question the Emoluments Clause applies to POTUS – including Trump. Severe remedies if its violated, including impeachment."
1927,Adam Schiff,It simply provides that no federal office holder can accept payment from a foreign nation without the explicit approval of Congress.
1928,Adam Schiff,"The Emoluments Clause isn’t well known, but it was very important to the Framers who worried about foreign influence in a young Republic."
1929,Adam Schiff,Trump must divest completely to prevent conflicts of interest. Why? The Constitution's Emoluments Clause. What’s that? Let me explain:

2065,Adam Schiff,"I'm working on legislation that will accomplish these goals, &amp; hope to introduce it in coming weeks before Congress comes back into session"
2066,Adam Schiff,It shouldn't fall on shoulders of those who serve our country to pay for the mistakes of others that offered these incentives improperly.
2067,Adam Schiff,Legislation can waive these debts &amp; provide relief to soldiers who have already repaid some or all of bonuses they accepted in good faith.
2068,Adam Schiff,"While this will help some families sleep a bit easier at night, much more needs to be done, starting with Congressional legislation."

2070,Adam Schiff,It's outrageous that National Guard soldiers are being asked to repay bonuses that they had every right to
2071,Adam Schiff,In the meantime the California National Guard should suspend all debt collection activities against these soldiers.
2072,Adam Schiff,Congress can and I believe will address this unacceptable situation.  I'm working on legislative remedy for when Congress is back in session

2093,Adam Schiff,And we must do everything in our power to guard against it.
2094,Adam Schiff,All of us should be gravely concerned when a foreign power like Russia seeks to undermine our democratic institutions.
2095,Adam Schiff,...to develop a concerted response that protects our institutions and deters further meddling.
2096,Adam Schiff,We should now work with our European allies who have been the victim of similar and even more malicious cyber interference by Russia ....

2143,Adam Schiff,Thoughtful piece from Ambassador @McFaul on how US can counter growing Russian influence by aiding democracy abroad:

2169,Adam Schiff,"With Donald Trump, the question isn't whether the intelligence briefings should occur, but whether they would do any good."
2170,Adam Schiff,Call by GOP to cancel briefings for Secretary Clinton and brief only Donald Trump is as predictable as it is absurd.
2171,Adam Schiff,Proud to welcome @JoaquinCastrotx to House Intelligence Committee. His experience and background will be invaluable to our oversight efforts
2172,Adam Schiff,.@NRA sponsored gun violence bill is a sham that fools no one. Americans deserve real action to #DisarmHate.

2177,Adam Schiff,California leads the way to #EndGunViolence while the House Majority plans only to allow a vote on NRA-favored bill.
2178,Adam Schiff,Military leaders made it clear they will refuse to violate the laws of war. Trump is unfit to be commander in chief

2180,Adam Schiff,"Today's @DeptofDefense announcement, ending discriminatory transgender service ban, is a major victory for #equality &amp; military preparedness"
2181,Adam Schiff,ICYMI: I spoke with @brikeilarcnn on CNN today about the release of the #BenghaziReport:
2182,Adam Schiff,ICYMI: I spoke with MSNBC's @mitchellreports about the release of the #BenghaziReport today:
2183,Adam Schiff,Read my full statement on the release of Republican's partisan #BenghaziReport this morning:
2184,Adam Schiff,R's conduct of #Benghazi committee &amp; report will go down as one of worst abuses of Congress's extraordinary investigative powers in history
2185,Adam Schiff,....so they issued their own addendum that is so blatantly political it should've been issued by RNC not a congressional committee #Benghazi
2186,Adam Schiff,"In their #Benghazi report today, some Republicans felt that Chairman Gowdy didn’t go far enough in attacking Secretary Clinton..."
2187,Adam Schiff,The partisan goal of #Benghazi Committee – to drive down Secretary Clinton's numbers –was demonstrated by behavior of the committee itself
2188,Adam Schiff,"In an eight hundred page #Benghazi report which attempts to substitute quantity for quality, it adds little that is appreciably new."
2189,Adam Schiff,"After $7m in taxpayer funds &amp; 2 years, R's #Benghazi report fails to alter core conclusions of the 8 other investigations that went before."
2190,Adam Schiff,Read my full statement on the release of the Democrats #Benghazi report today:
2191,Adam Schiff,"It's my hope that by issuing our report, as unremarkable as findings are, we can finally put this sad political chapter behind us. #Benghazi"
2192,Adam Schiff,"Rs withheld transcripts, subjected Clinton to an 11 hour hearing &amp; produced official Committee report without any input or review from Dems."
2193,Adam Schiff,"Republicans excluded Democrats from participating in certain interviews (even concealed them), issued subpoenas with no consultation or vote"
2194,Adam Schiff,"When investigation began, Chairman Gowdy promised to put aside partisanship to work with Democrats – regrettably, reality was very different"
2195,Adam Schiff,"Although we found some new details about events of that tragic night, they merely provided context rather than changing what we already knew"
2196,Adam Schiff,"Republicans opted to conduct business in shockingly partisan fashion, not even sharing draft report with Dems for input or comment #Benghazi"
2197,Adam Schiff,"Instead, most partisan select committee in Congressional history merely harmed reputation of GOP leadership &amp; members that gave birth to it."
2198,Adam Schiff,The #Benghazi Committee's principal objective of damaging the political prospects of Secretary Hillary Clinton was also unrealized.
2199,Adam Schiff,"After 2 years &amp; $7m in taxpayer funds, #Benghazi Committee result is unsurprising – nothing alters core conclusions of other investigations."
2200,Adam Schiff,Today's #SCOTUS ruling in #WholeWomansHealth reaffirms critical protections for reproductive freedoms.
2201,Adam Schiff,"One year ago, love won. #LoveWins #LoveIsLove"

2204,Adam Schiff,"This great man goes to speak to the crowd...and the crowd responds ""we're with you."" @RepJohnLewis"
2205,Adam Schiff,".@repjohnlewis ends sit-in for now, harkening back to the civil rights movement ""when I was in jail, I felt free."""
2206,Adam Schiff,Why can't we get a vote? Because Republican leadership is caught in the stranglehold of the NRA!
2207,Adam Schiff,"The view from the Capitol, circa 2:15 am, where supporters still assemble to urge Congress to ""do your job""."
2208,Adam Schiff,Spoke with CNN's @donlemon to explain why House Democrats have been sitting in on the House Floor.
2209,Adam Schiff,"We each hold the name of a victim of gun violence. My sign reads ""Steven Curnow."" #NoBillNoBreak #EnoughIsEnough"
2210,Adam Schiff,A speaker with no voice for the victims tries to gavel down those who call out. #HoldTheFloor #NoMoreSilence #Enough
2211,Adam Schiff,Delete your account.
2212,Adam Schiff,"Not how I expected to spend my birthday, but I'm glad to be here. #NoBillNoBreak"

2217,Adam Schiff,.@SenWarren joins our sit in #holdthefloor #NoBillNoBreak
2218,Adam Schiff,Majority doesn't want you to know what's being said; just wants gun issue to go away. It'll never go away unless Congress acts #HoldTheFloor
2219,Adam Schiff,"Just finished speaking during the #NoBillNoBreak sit-in. But you'll never see it, as Majority have turned off the cameras &amp; microphones."
2220,Adam Schiff,Enough is enough. This is House equivalent of a fillbuster. American people demand action &amp; we must demand it of ourselves. #NoBillNoBreak
2221,Adam Schiff,"Have joined sit-in on the House Floor, led by @RepJohnLewis, to insist on a vote on gun safety legislation. #EnoughIsEnough #NoBillNoBreak"
2222,Adam Schiff,"✔️ Decades of service✔️ Highest rating from @ABAesq of ""well-qualified"" (https://t.co/Q82OI1pMkK)#DoYourJob Senate! Vote on Judge Garland!"
2223,Adam Schiff,Appalling to see that the Senate rejected legislation to #EndGunViolence four times tonight. #Enough silence – we need action.
2224,Adam Schiff,We must also pass “No Fly No Buy” legislation to prevent gun purchases by dangerous terrorists. #Enough
2225,Adam Schiff,We should alert law enforcement to purchase so that they can undertake a follow-up investigation. Could have disrupted Orlando plot.
2226,Adam Schiff,Wrote @POTUS requesting system to notify FBI when a previously investigated terror suspect seeks to buy a gun. Read:
2227,Adam Schiff,".@ChrisMurphyCT, I stand with your #filibuster. No more terrorist access to assault weapons. No more mass shootings. #ENOUGH"

2231,Adam Schiff,"Donald Trump's next impulse after terror attack was to ban Muslims again; how predictable, how counter-productive."
2232,Adam Schiff,Donald Trump's first impulse after the terror attack was to congratulate himself. How very Presidential.
2233,Adam Schiff,Joined @NPRinskeep on NPR's @MorningEdition about what we know &amp; what questions we're asking about #Orlando. Listen:
2234,Adam Schiff,"To all those tweeting me after yet another tragedy: I hear you, I agree with you. Congress must act to pass common-sense gun laws. #NoExcuse"
2235,Adam Schiff,The mass shooting in #Orlando was an attack on the LGBT community and all Americans. An act of terror and hate.
2236,Adam Schiff,ICYMI: I spoke with @jaketapper on @CNNSotu this morning about the tragic #Orlando attack:

2239,Adam Schiff,"Shtetl to Congress, Three Generations: #ImmigrationStoryin5Words"

2242,Adam Schiff,I'll be joining @maddow on MSNBC at 6 pm PT/9 pm ET to discuss Donald Trump's dangerous foreign policy.

2255,Adam Schiff,Congress has acted on gun violence. But it was a major step back - to protect the gun industry.
2256,Adam Schiff,Big News! I really think we're on track to get this system up and running in the next few years.
2257,Adam Schiff,Anti-Muslim bigotry only aids Islamist terrorists to our own detriment. Here's General David Petraeus' take:
2258,Adam Schiff,"All students, including trans students, should be treated with dignity &amp; respect. Thank you @TheJusticeDept @USEDGov"
2259,Adam Schiff,This won’t solve opioid crisis &amp; I’m disappointed House didn’t consider broader legislation but this was small step forward in larger effort
2260,Adam Schiff,House unanimously passed my amendment to explore creation of national database to prevent doctor shopping of
2261,Adam Schiff,"@RepSteveIsrael a dubious honor, to be sure! #CongratsOrSomething"
2262,Adam Schiff,Proud to see @TheJusticeDept fight discrimination in all its forms. This is about dignity &amp; respect for ALL. #HB2
2263,Adam Schiff,Proud to receive 100% from @Defenders of Wildlife. Protecting wildlife corridors in Rim of the Valley is key.
2264,Adam Schiff,Will a Corporate Carve-Out Derail Criminal Justice Reform? My op-ed with @SenatorDurbin &amp; @SenWhitehouse: https://t.co/cKFLNZ7pP7 #CJReform
2265,Adam Schiff,"As we get even closer to 2016 election, all but most dedicated partisans have written off Committee as one of the worst investigative abuses"
2266,Adam Schiff,"Cost for investigating #Benghazi including Committee coupled with costs imposed on  State, Defense &amp; other agencies is now over $20 million."
2267,Adam Schiff,"Now 2 years later, with no new evidence to alter core conclusions of other investigations, Republicans have reached new level of desperation"
2268,Adam Schiff,It's been apparent since beginning that the #Benghazi Select Committee would be little more than a politically-motivated fishing expedition.
2269,Adam Schiff,Apparent from beginning that #Benghazi Committee would be little more than politically motivated fishing expedition.
2270,Adam Schiff,The FY 2017 Intelligence Authorization Act has passed unanimously in House Intelligence Committee this morning:
2271,Adam Schiff,New funding is needed to fight #Zika &amp; we cannot continue to rob Peter to pay Paul when the consequences are so dire
2272,Adam Schiff,"Proud to support @LA2024 bid to host Summer #Olympics! Where else do you get the infrastructure, enthusiasm and sun?"
2273,Adam Schiff,Always great to join @KTLAMorningNews. We discussed the fight to recognize the #ArmenianGenocide &amp; yesterday's march
2274,Adam Schiff,I believe that we should move to declassify the #28Pages of the Congressional 9/11 report. I explained why on MSNBC:
2275,Adam Schiff,"We will never forget the 1.5 million men, women and children murdered in #ArmenianGenocide. #NeverForget1915"
2276,Adam Schiff,"Take a moment today to read tweets and remembrances of the #ArmenianGenocide. Their wounds, our wounds, are still open."
2277,Adam Schiff,"To all of my constituents celebrating #Passover this coming week, may you and your family have a joyous holiday. Chag Sameach!"
2278,Adam Schiff,We only have one planet earth -- we should do all we can to protect it! #EarthDay
2279,Adam Schiff,Instead this decision will be just another sad milestone in struggle to prevent genocide by exposing genocide and its perpetrators.
2280,Adam Schiff,Recognition of the #ArmenianGenocide could have been a proud part of President Obama's legacy...
2281,Adam Schiff,How many administrations must be intimidated into silence before we realize that it only emboldens the increasingly authoritarian regime?
2282,Adam Schiff,How many administrations must be intimidated into silence before we realize that it never changes Turkish behavior for the better?
2283,Adam Schiff,Remaining silent in an effort to curry favor with Turkey is as morally indefensible as it will be ineffectual. #ArmenianGenocide
2284,Adam Schiff,"...and who has always championed human rights, the choice of silence and complicity is all the more painfully inexplicable #ArmenianGenocide"
2285,Adam Schiff,"For a President who knows the history so well, who spoke so passionately about the genocide as a Senator and a Presidential candidate...."
2286,Adam Schiff,I’m gravely disappointed that President Obama will now leave office without fulfilling his commitment to recognize the #ArmenianGenocide.
2287,Adam Schiff,Troubled by findings in Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index. #PressFreedom is under assault world-wide!
2288,Adam Schiff,There is no higher calling than speaking truth in face of genocide denial. My letter to @POTUS on #ArmenianGenocide:
2289,Adam Schiff,Heading to the House Floor shortly to deliver an open letter to President Obama on the #ArmenianGenocide. 10 am ET/7 am PT on CSPAN.
2290,Adam Schiff,"Dear Senate: you must #DoYourJob, hold hearings on nomination of Judge Garland, &amp; up or down vote. There's no excuse"
2291,Adam Schiff,Proud to support. OSS helped vanquish some of most malevolent enemies our country— and free world— has ever faced.
2292,Adam Schiff,This act of hatred has no place in our community. Disturbed someone would be threatened over their Armenian heritage
2293,Adam Schiff,Just voted NO on a bill to undermine FCC’s #netneutrality rule. We need to protect consumers and keep the Internet open.
2294,Adam Schiff,@EdenYoon Eye was happy to meet with you too!
2295,Adam Schiff,"Happy #JackieRobinsonDay! In 1947, the Pasadena-native took the field in a Dodgers uniform &amp; became the first African American in the #MLB"
2296,Adam Schiff,"Welcome to DC @RideOnTeam26, congrats on an inspiring ride. Time for Congress to act &amp; protect our communities from gun violence #NotOneMore"
2297,Adam Schiff,"On this #EqualPayDay, we must recognize the need to ensure our country provides women with equal pay for equal work."

2306,Adam Schiff,"Voting is open in the Congressional Art Competition for our ""People's Choice"" award! Vote: https://t.co/Ggf8SFfzvR"
2307,Adam Schiff,Terrible bombing in Lahore Pakistan took 71 lives. Jamaat-e-Ahrar supposedly targeted Christians on Easter. Yet another horror #LahoreBlast
2308,Adam Schiff,"Happy #Easter to all those celebrating today! I hope it is filled with good friends and family, and of course quality chocolate!"
2309,Adam Schiff,"It should serve as strong message to all hackers, whether criminals or nations, that anonymity not guaranteed online"
2310,Adam Schiff,"Obamacare turns six today, providing millions insurance &amp; life-saving access for those w/ pre-existing conditions."
2311,Adam Schiff,"These proposals show that claiming to oppose ""political correctness"" is often a subterfuge for expressing the most divisive &amp; bigoted views."
2312,Adam Schiff,".@tedcruz demagogic suggestion we ""patrol"" Muslim neighborhoods will lead to greater radicalization here &amp; feed into ISIS narrative abroad."
2313,Adam Schiff,Comments by Senator @tedcruz are also as offensive and ill-informed as they are counterproductive.
2314,Adam Schiff,.@realDonaldTrump obviously knows little about how to obtain reliable and accurate intelligence
2315,Adam Schiff,.@realDonaldTrump comments espousing the virtues of torture are spoken by a person with no national security experience....
2316,Adam Schiff,Torture is immoral &amp; illegal. It is also great way to get people to say anything to make pain stop and send authorities chasing false leads
2317,Adam Schiff,Statements from @realDonaldTrump &amp; @tedcruz in wake of #BrusselsAttacks have been appalling &amp; dangerous to our national security.
2318,Adam Schiff,…shows how difficult and dangerous the threat from ISIS remains. #Brussels
2319,Adam Schiff,That the attackers could go forward even when Brussels was under constant vigilance for just this kind of assault...
2320,Adam Schiff,"In wake of attacks, US &amp; our allies across Europe must be on alert for possible copy-cat attackers who activate in wake of these bombings."
2321,Adam Schiff,....even if it is still more likely to come from home-grown radicals than ISIS fighters returning from Syria or Iraq.  #Brussels
2322,Adam Schiff,"And as we saw in San Bernardino, we are not immune from the threat at home…"
2323,Adam Schiff,"It is enormously difficult to track all of them, or defend soft targets like those attacked in Brussels and previously in Paris."
2324,Adam Schiff,"Europe is facing a real threat from the thousands who have traveled abroad to Syria and Iraq to train with ISIS, and have returned home."
2325,Adam Schiff,Terrorist bombings this morning – focused on airport &amp; transit system – bear all hallmarks of ISIS-inspired or coordinated attack. #Brussels
2326,Adam Schiff,"Don't often agree w/ George Will, but do here: GOP arguments against hearings on SCOTUS nominee are patently wrong."
2327,Adam Schiff,Thank you @DrLucyJones for years of leadership in earthquake preparedness &amp; safety. We are grateful your work will continue at @Caltech.
2328,Adam Schiff,I'm deeply disappointed in #HSR Authority’s decision to move forward w/ these routes through Angeles National Forest
2329,Adam Schiff,Pleased @DeptofDefense nominated Gen. Lori Robinson as 1st female US combatant commander. Looking forward to more women in leadership roles.
2330,Adam Schiff,Just voted NO on @SpeakerRyan’s plan to speak on behalf of the House in SCOTUS case on DAPA and expanded DACA. Let’s #KeepFamiliesTogether.
2331,Adam Schiff,"Congress should now pass the ORCA Act to make these changes permanent across the country, not just at SeaWorld, but in all parks."
2332,Adam Schiff,These changes are something advocates have been urging for years. @SeaWorld will find visitors will reward with renewed interest in parks.
2333,Adam Schiff,.@SeaWorld decision to end captive breeding means that current generation of captive Orcas in parks will be last.
2334,Adam Schiff,My full statement on Justice Garland as #SCOTUSnominee:
2335,Adam Schiff,Judge Garland deserves hearing before the Senate &amp; vote on nomination ASAP. Anything else would set a dangerous precedent. #SCOTUSnominee
2336,Adam Schiff,"With today's nomination of Merrick Garland, @POTUS chose #SCOTUSnominee that is superbly qualified for our nation’s highest court."
2337,Adam Schiff,ICYMI: I joined @KTLAMorningNews to discuss the #AppleVsFBI case this week and what's likely to happen in Congress:

2349,Adam Schiff,"Even in the midst of heated campaign, it’s the responsibility of all who believe in rule of law &amp; human rights to condemn these remarks."
2350,Adam Schiff,"Let’s be clear: these are war crimes, no matter who is ordering or carrying out, whether field commander, agency head, general, or president"
2351,Adam Schiff,".@realDonaldTrump cannot have it both ways – will be abide by the laws of war and denounce these positions, or won't he?"
2352,Adam Schiff,"Although @realDonaldTrump has now said that he would obey law, he has yet to specifically disavow torture or killing families of our enemies"
2353,Adam Schiff,A major step forward for gender equality this #WomensHistoryMonth as the military begins to recruit #WomeninCombat.

2365,Adam Schiff,"Closing the #Guantanamo prison will make us safer, it will save us money, and it is the right thing to do."
2366,Adam Schiff,"At very least Congress should get out of way &amp; lift restrictions that make it difficult or impossible to close Guantanamo, once and for all."
2367,Adam Schiff,It's time for Congress to work with the Administration to put in place a legal regime that works – not block it at every turn. #GTMO
2368,Adam Schiff,"...for duration of conflict under laws of war, our maximum security prisons or military facilities are more than capable of doing the job."
2369,Adam Schiff,"As report to Congress makes clear, to degree that a category of detainees are not suitable for prosecution and must continue to be held ..."

2388,Adam Schiff,China's desire to maintain a divided Korean peninsula as a buffer against the United States cannot outweigh the danger...
2389,Adam Schiff,China's efforts to moderate North Korea have failed. Beijing must join intn'l community in supporting stronger sanctions on the rogue regime
2390,Adam Schiff,... to defy multiple UN res by proceeding with ballistic missile tests signals that he views himself as unconstrained by any intn'l norms.

2403,Adam Schiff,"Good gun companies don’t need special immunity from the law, and bad gun companies certainly don’t deserve it. #RepealPLCAA"
2404,Adam Schiff,PLCAA repeal provides victims w/ justice while creating incentives for responsible business practices that would reduce injuries and deaths.
2405,Adam Schiff,@SenBlumenthal &amp; I introduced legislation to repeal PLCAA which shields gun industry from liability when it acts negligently. #RepealPLCAA

2413,Adam Schiff,"We have witnessed in Iran's continued support for terrorism, its ballistic missile violations.... (1/2)"
2414,Adam Schiff,We will still have deep differences with Iran and no one should expect to see any sweeping changes in the malevolent nature of the regime...
2415,Adam Schiff,"In particular, we will need to guard against any Iranian effort to obtain nuclear material or technology from proliferators abroad."
2416,Adam Schiff,#IranDeal was never predicated on trust but on an intrusive inspections regime designed to ensure Iran would fully implement its commitments
2417,Adam Schiff,"The U.S. &amp; IAEA will need to work 24/7 to monitor Iran's continued compliance, stand ready to reimpose some or all of sanctions if necessary"
2418,Adam Schiff,"But the announcement that ""Implementation Day"" has arrived is only a beginning."
2419,Adam Schiff,"Most important, these steps have pushed Iran's potential breakout time to more than a year, instead of a matter of weeks or months #IranDeal"

2468,Adam Schiff,Absurd and un-American -- the only way to describe Donald Trump's call to bar all Muslims from entry into the US. Great propaganda for ISIS.
2469,Adam Schiff,"On this day that will live on in infamy, we remember those who tragically lost their lives &amp; thank those who serve our country. #PearlHarbor"
2470,Adam Schiff,"To all lighting first candle on menorah this evening, I hope this begins wonderful Hannukah celebration for your family. Happy Hannukah!"
2471,Adam Schiff,"Absolutely, no question. Congress must end its abdication of responsibility on a new #AUMF."
2472,Adam Schiff,"Towards that end, I have been working on new draft authorization to combat ISIS &amp; Al Qaeda that I plan to present in the coming days. #AUMF"
2473,Adam Schiff,I also urge Congress to take up an authorization for the use of force against ISIS and end its abdication of responsibility over war effort.
2474,Adam Schiff,".@POTUS right. We must pass legislation to deprive #NoFlyList access to guns, and to curtail the wide availability of assault weapons"
2475,Adam Schiff,...And must do far more with community abroad to counter the pernicious bastardization of the faith that urges the slaughter of innocents.
2476,Adam Schiff,We will continue to work closely with the Islamic community in the United States to identify those at risk of radicalization...
2477,Adam Schiff,And in this facet of the struggle -- as @POTUS pointed out -- the Muslim community at home and abroad must be our chief ally.
2478,Adam Schiff,"Ultimately, ISIS must be defeated on the ideological battlefield as well as militarily."
2479,Adam Schiff,"...its capacity to inspire followers &amp; supporters around the world &amp; here at home, &amp; its ability to mount another massive coordinated attack"
2480,Adam Schiff,"When ISIS ceases to hold territory, will still be threat for many years, but world will have degraded its perceived aura of invincibility..."
2481,Adam Schiff,"These attacks demonstrate urgency of defeating ISIS &amp; depriving it of time, resources &amp; space in Iraq and Syria to plot and plan against us."
2482,Adam Schiff,...that those radicalized by ISIS propaganda here at home would choose now to act on its malicious urgings
2483,Adam Schiff,The ISIS-inspired mass shooting in San Bernardino was the realization of our gravest fear after the Paris attacks... #POTUSSpeech
2484,Adam Schiff,"I talked with @AlexWitt on MSNBC today about the threat from radicalization from ISIS propaganda, and #SanBernardino"
2485,Adam Schiff,"Women have served, fought &amp; died for our country. Decision by Sec Carter to allow #WomenInCombat is absolutely right"
2486,Adam Schiff,"For my full statement on the #SanBernardino shootings, please read:"
2487,Adam Schiff,"I am ready to trade the moments of silence, for moments of action. #NotOneMore #EnoughIsEnough"
2488,Adam Schiff,"I don't want to lose another father, mother or child to crazed gunman, and I don't want U.S. to be known around world for its gun violence."
2489,Adam Schiff,My constituents don't accept that weekly mass shootings are new normal or that we're incapable of doing anything about it. And neither do I.
2490,Adam Schiff,"These reforms may or may not have impacted shooting in San Bernardino or its lethality, but they would save lives in countless other cases."
2491,Adam Schiff,Why does anyone need military style assault weapon with extended ammunition clip for hunting or self-protection?  Simple answer: they don’t.
2492,Adam Schiff,"Must require background check for every gun sale, make easier to preclude those w serious mental health probs from gaining access weapons."
2493,Adam Schiff,"There are many reasonable proposals in Congress that would, without question, reduce gun violence and mass shootings in America. #NotOneMore"
2494,Adam Schiff,"I am confident the FBI will get to the bottom of what took place and why, and whether anything might have been done to prevent the attack."
2495,Adam Schiff,At this point it is too early to rule anything in or out – it may have been workplace violence or it may have been more.
2496,Adam Schiff,FBI is conducting investigation into suspects to determine motive &amp; whether there is any connection to terror or evidence of radicalization.
2497,Adam Schiff,"This morning, I was briefed by the FBI on the investigation into the mass shooting in #SanBernardino."
2498,Adam Schiff,"At this point, we can’t rule anything out. We're examining if any links to terror, workplace violence or other motivations. #SanBernardino"
2499,Adam Schiff,I would much rather have moments of action than moments of silence on the House floor. #NotOneMore #EnoughIsEnough
2500,Adam Schiff,"British Parliament deserves credit for doing something Congress has yet to undertake, and that is, allow a full debate and vote on #ISIS war"
2501,Adam Schiff,"Once facts are known &amp; shooter, or shooters, are apprehended, we need to intensify efforts to end scourge of gun violence across country."
2502,Adam Schiff,Horrified by images of a mass shooting in #SanBernardino. Absolutely horrified. We are closely monitoring situation.
2503,Adam Schiff,".@RepMikeRogers Thanks, Mike. Continuing a fine tradition of bipartisan Intel cooperation established by you and @Call_Me_Dutch"
2504,Adam Schiff,On #WorldAIDSDay let's recommit to supporting research for cure &amp; continue challenging stigma surrounding diagnosis
2505,Adam Schiff,"We also must never let our focus on any 1 threat distract us from other challenges we face like those from Iran, North Korea, Russia &amp; China"
2506,Adam Schiff,"Recent Paris attacks drive home how vigilant we need to be, and the IAA provides urgent resources for the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda."
2507,Adam Schiff,House just overwhelmingly approved the FY 2016 Intelligence Authorization Act (HR 4127) on a bipartisan 364-58 vote.
2508,Adam Schiff,Real vulnerability is people with European passports who can travel without a visa to U.S. And we're going to have to address that issue.
2509,Adam Schiff,"On @ThisWeekABC: One continuing vulnerability is our airports. All too often, when we test the TSA, they"
2510,Adam Schiff,We have to do something other than this now routine pantomime of condolence after a mass shooting. #EnoughIsEnough
2511,Adam Schiff,"As we continue to confront terrorist threats, reforms such as these are a model of how privacy and security need not be mutually exclusive"
2512,Adam Schiff,"Even now, after bipartisan momentum to end #NSA bulk collection, some have used recent attacks in Paris as an excuse to restart the program."
2513,Adam Schiff,At heart of gun violence problem all too often is easy access to lethal weapons by people with serious mental health problems #EnoughIsEnoug
2514,Adam Schiff,What's needed is legislative action by Congress to combat gun violence and increase gun safety in America. #EnoughIsEnough
2515,Adam Schiff,Our hearts go out to his family &amp; families of other victims. But words are not enough and ring hollow each time we see another mass killing.
2516,Adam Schiff,"Another mass shooting, this time in Colorado at a Planned Parenthood where 3 died, including Officer Swasey who gave life to protect others"
2517,Adam Schiff,Will be talking with @MarthaRaddatz on @ThisWeekABC on Sunday about terror threat &amp; ISIS strategy in Syria and Iraq.
2518,Adam Schiff,Happy Thanksgiving!
2519,Adam Schiff,My family is going to NYC Thanksgiving parade &amp; we will be there w/ Americans from all over country to participate in time-honored tradition
2520,Adam Schiff,"Intelligence community &amp; law enforcement are taking every precaution to keep our country safe, and to protect our communities."
2521,Adam Schiff,There is always the risk that people on the fringes of society will choose now to act on the social media urgings of ISIS.
2522,Adam Schiff,"After multiple briefings, I share @POTUS assessment that there is no specific, credible threat to U.S. arising out of the Paris plot."
2523,Adam Schiff,"The Paris attacks have many Americans on edge during this holiday season, and this is understandable in light of the horror of those events."
2524,Adam Schiff,#CPIA would help #KeepKidsSafe by ensuring youth programs access to nationwide background checks.
2525,Adam Schiff,Congress must act on increase in violence against trans community to ensure they feel safe from discrimination &amp; brutality. #equality4trans
2526,Adam Schiff,Let’s honor #ChildrensDay by ratifying UN Convention on Rights of Children. US remains the only UN nation not to ratify the #CRC.
2527,Adam Schiff,"Takes 1-2 yrs to be vetted &amp; come to US as a refugee. Of approx. 2,000 #SyrianRefugees resettled here, none has been arrested for terrorism."
2528,Adam Schiff,"There are persistent threats to country from ISIS, Al Qaeda and homegrown extremists, not from women &amp; children fleeing violence in #Syria."
2529,Adam Schiff,"We shouldn't bar door to people fleeing ISIS violence, often religious minorities, who have nowhere else to go, &amp; bill would've done that."
2530,Adam Schiff,I just voted against the House bill to halt #SyrianRefugee program.
2531,Adam Schiff,"Great to join @KTLAMorningNews to discuss the upcoming #SyriaRefugees vote in Congress, and latest in Paris attacks."
2532,Adam Schiff,We should discuss with Turkey &amp; Jordan a buffer zone that would be policed on ground by Turkish/ Gulf nations &amp; from the air by US/coalition
2533,Adam Schiff,And even the best intelligence agencies — and we have the best — aren’t going to be able to stop every plot.
2534,Adam Schiff,We have to put an end to that ISIS sanctuary in Iraq/Syria if we’re going to dramatically reduce the risk to our country.
2535,Adam Schiff,"Until we successfully evaporate ISIS sanctuary in Syria, they will have time, space &amp; resources to plot against us."
2536,Adam Schiff,Nobody in Congress has standing to complain about Administration's conduct in ISIS war when we don’t have guts to debate &amp; vote on an #AUMF.
2537,Adam Schiff,We need not choose between security &amp; compassion for women &amp; children fleeing ISIS. Keep our strong #SyrianRefugee vetting process working!
2538,Adam Schiff,LA City Hall lit up last night in solidarity with #Paris. We cannot allow tragedy to divide us or harden our hearts
2539,Adam Schiff,Our commitment to refugees &amp; security of American people are not mutually exclusive. @RepZoeLofgren @HomelandDems
2540,Adam Schiff,"Joined CNN's @NewDay to discuss the latest in the investigation into the #ParisAttacks, what we know &amp; what we don't"
2541,Adam Schiff,"@MariaSansone @gdla always a pleasure to join you, @SteveGDLA  and @Araksya, even when in DC!"
2542,Adam Schiff,I'll be talking with @chrislhayes on MSNBC @allinwithchris at 8:15 pm ET/5:15 pm ET about the #ParisAttacks. #inners
2543,Adam Schiff,Glad to see Washington Post support the effort to end the captivity of killer whales. #ORCAact
2544,Adam Schiff,"Today, I formally introduced the ORCA Act to responsibly phase out keeping orcas in captivity for public display."
2545,Adam Schiff,"When world is experiencing refugee crisis of magnitude not seen since WWII, are we to abandon allies awash w refugees &amp; not do our part?"
2546,Adam Schiff,"Will we preserve our cherished freedoms, our liberty and our privacy even while we take steps to steel our defenses?"
2547,Adam Schiff,"It is in times like these, when fear of future attacks is at its greatest &amp; pain of loss is most acute, that values of a nation are tested."
2548,Adam Schiff,"Will need to examine &amp; intensify rigorous national security checks on potential refugees, &amp; take all possible steps to vet those we admit."
2549,Adam Schiff,Turning our backs on refugees runs counter to proud &amp; generous heritage of U.S. that has always helped those in need during turbulent times.
2550,Adam Schiff,Spoke with @NPRinskeep on @MorningEdition about the #ParisAttacks &amp; limits of intelligence. Thanks for having me on.
2551,Adam Schiff,.@jahimes absolutely right. Administration acknowledges we are at war. Yet w/o Congressional authorization. Time for Congress to do its job.
2552,Adam Schiff,Even the best intelligence will not stop a determined enemy that adapts to our defenses and ISIS has adapted. #ParisAttacks
2553,Adam Schiff,We cannot allow ISIS to have unmolested sanctuary in Syria &amp; Iraq to plan &amp; direct attacks against us because some attacks will get through.
2554,Adam Schiff,"We’re a harder target, a harder target to reach, but we know ISIS aspires to attack us here in the United States as well."
2555,Adam Schiff,"The #ParisAttacks were an ISIS attack, likely directed and equipped out of Syria. My interview on @ThisWeekABC:"
2556,Adam Schiff,I'll be talking with @GStephanopoulos on  @ThisWeekABC tomorrow morning to discuss the #ParisAttack.
2557,Adam Schiff,Read my full statement below:
2558,Adam Schiff,"I will continue to be briefed as details emerge &amp; want to express my deepest sympathies to the French people, the victims and their families"
2559,Adam Schiff,"Many hundreds of French citizens have traveled to Syria and Iraq, and the risk from those who return is well known and severe."
2560,Adam Schiff,...this clearly coordinated series of violent acts bears all the hallmarks of international terrorism. 2/2
2561,Adam Schiff,"While we await determination of the identity of those responsible &amp; their motivation, given disturbing similarities to other attacks... 1/2"
2562,Adam Schiff,.@PauleyP Horrified to hear of your attack. Sending you well wishes for a speedy recovery and so grateful for all you do for our community.
2563,Adam Schiff,"If death confirmed, would be significant blow to ISIS &amp; their international propaganda efforts, &amp;  measure of justice for those he butchered"
2564,Adam Schiff,"Intelligence community &amp; DOD are working hard to confirm if he was indeed killed, but this is someone we have been after for quite some time"
2565,Adam Schiff,"Last evening, I was notified that U.S. military forces conducted an airstrike in Raqqa targeting Mohamed Emwazi, also known as ""Jihadi John"""
2566,Adam Schiff,"Well done, @Munchkin_Inc!"
2567,Adam Schiff,Proud of @POTUS for voicing his support of the #EqualityAct and seeking an end to discrimination based on sexual orientation or identity.
2568,Adam Schiff,"Thank you to all veterans who have served our country. And thank you, Dad (go Army). This #VeteransDay &amp; every day, we salute your sacrifice"
2569,Adam Schiff,Read my full statement and information on the legislation I proposed -- The ORCA Act -- here:
2570,Adam Schiff,"Fact remains that as long as they holds orcas in captivity, physical &amp; psychological problems associated with their captivity will persist."
2571,Adam Schiff,Much more needs to be done &amp; I would urge SeaWorld to curtail the breeding of their orcas and partner in the creation of ocean sanctuaries.
2572,Adam Schiff,Decision by #SeaWorld to phase out killer whale shows in San Diego is welcome step towards ending captivity of these magnificent creatures.
2573,Adam Schiff,"If this is a bomb by the affiliate of ISIS in the Sinai, ISIS has now fully eclipsed al-Qaeda as the gravest terror threat in the world."
2574,Adam Schiff,"This is a problem here at home, too. When we test the TSA, they fail. And I think we really need to step up our security here."
2575,Adam Schiff,"There’s a growing body of intelligence and evidence that this was a bomb, still not conclusive, but a growing body of evidence."
2576,Adam Schiff,Was on @ThisWeekABC w @GStephanopoulos to discuss whether ISIS was responsible for bringing down #Metrojet airliner.
2577,Adam Schiff,I'll be appearing on @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos on Sunday to discuss the latest on the #RussianPlane and #ISIS.
2578,Adam Schiff,"Orcas are too socially complex, too intelligent, too long-lived and simply too big to thrive in confinement #ORCAact"
2579,Adam Schiff,I announced today I will be introducing the ORCA Act to phase out orca captivity nationwide https://t.co/pZmeg8hgsO
2580,Adam Schiff,"Strong #jobsreport, adding 268k new jobs and bringing unemployment rate to 5 percent, lowest since 2008. Still want to see more wage growth."
2581,Adam Schiff,#ISIS does have capability to place bomb on aircraft b/c it doesn’t require a lot of sophistication @mitchellreports
2582,Adam Schiff,.@SenFeinstein is is exactly right -- it's time to close Gitmo.
2583,Adam Schiff,I would urge people not to jump to any conclusions yet on #Russian airplane. Still trying to confirm cause of crash.
2584,Adam Schiff,Vote to repeal LGBT nondiscrimination law in #Houston unfortunate reminder how much is left to be done to achieve equality in America. #HERO
2585,Adam Schiff,"Over 20,000 #Syrians already  screened by @DHSgov &amp; who have family members in US can be admitted if President grants humanitarian parole."
2586,Adam Schiff,I urged @POTUS to grant humanitarian parole to #SyrianRefugees with approved immigrant petitions and family in U.S.
2587,Adam Schiff,#ClimateChange undeniably a catalyst for conflict in vulnerable countries. My op-ed on its nat'l security impacts:
2588,Adam Schiff,My statement on Obama Administration's decision to send U.S. special operations forces into Syria to fight #ISIS.
2589,Adam Schiff,"The House just chose Rep. Paul Ryan as our new Speaker. He's a good man and a friend, and I wish him well. We need to work together."
2590,Adam Schiff,This budget deal puts us in position to move away from governing crisis to crisis &amp; make smart investments in our future. #BudgetDeal
2591,Adam Schiff,"Today, colleagues and I sent letter urging @POTUS to increase budget for West Coast Earthquake Early Warning System."
2592,Adam Schiff,Just voted to reauthorize the #ExImBank which supports US exports and - most importantly - US jobs #ExIm4Jobs
2593,Adam Schiff,Pleased Senate joined House in passing cyber information sharing bill &amp; I'm confident we will reach final agreement.
2594,Adam Schiff,Will be talking with @wolfblitzer on @CNNSitRoom at 5:10 pm ET/2:10 pm PT about ISIS in Syria.
2595,Adam Schiff,We must not let implementation of Positive Train Control be next issue that Congress kicks down road in perpetuity.
2596,Adam Schiff,Spoke with @FaceTheNation this morning. It's difficult to justify continuation of #Benghazi Committee investigation

2598,Adam Schiff,"As required by my bet w/ @RepSteveIsrael here's my rendition of ""Meet the Mets."" Didn't say I had to be"

2601,Adam Schiff,ICYMI: Spoke with @maddow on MSNBC following conclusion of Secretary Clinton's testimony before #BenghaziCommittee:
2602,Adam Schiff,"Clinton today demonstrated why she made such a good Secretary of State, especially in light of the lengthy &amp; partisan questioning. #Benghazi"
2603,Adam Schiff,WATCH: My second round of questioning of Secretary Clinton before the #BenghaziCommittee tonight. Still more to go.
2604,Adam Schiff,#BenghaziCommittee in 2nd round of questioning w/Secretary Clinton. Still no word from Chairman how late we will go
2605,Adam Schiff,Fact – CIA told us there was nothing in that email that was classified nor was the name of that person who was well known to many.
2606,Adam Schiff,you risked the lives of people by sending an email that contained the name of a classified CIA source.
2607,Adam Schiff,"Fact – As recently as last week the Chairman issued a thirteen page letter, which alleges that...."
2608,Adam Schiff,twenty-seven of them are about you or the State Department and five are about everything else.
2609,Adam Schiff,Fact – of the thirty-two press releases that have been issued since March of this year....
2610,Adam Schiff,"Fact –Of 70k pages of documents obtained by Committee, only documents Chairman has chosen to release publicly are HRC emails with Blumenthal"
2611,Adam Schiff,Fact – We haven’t had a single hearing with the Department of Defense in seventeen months.

2613,Adam Schiff,"Fact – After NYT issued its story in March, this Committee canceled all other hearings, except for the hearing with a witness named Clinton."

2652,Adam Schiff,"It’s time to pass long-term funding bills that allow agencies &amp; government to plan for future, rather than governing from crisis to crisis."

2655,Adam Schiff,.@GOPLeader acknowledgment of #Benghazi Committee's true &amp; illegitimate objective further underscores that it is time to shut Committee down
2656,Adam Schiff,"In boasting of how #Benghazi Committee had driven down Clinton  poll #s, @GOPLeader laid bare abusive purpose of taxpayer funded committee."
2657,Adam Schiff,Blunt admission by @GOPLeader on #Benghazi Committee: has little to do with tragic night &amp; everything to do with attacking Hillary Clinton.

2659,Adam Schiff,It’s my hope that #MarsAnnouncement will ensure Congress fully funds Mars Program &amp; the Administration keeps the Mars 2020 mission on track
2660,Adam Schiff,Wow!
2661,Adam Schiff,Proliferation of special committees to score political points sets dangerous precedent both parties will come to regret in the years to come
2662,Adam Schiff,"When House created #Benghazi Committee, I feared it would mark new era of taxpayer-funded partisan committees. Those fears have come to pass"
2663,Adam Schiff,"Two years later, and the #DRC still refuses to issue exit visas for adopted children. It's time to end this injustice and #UniteOurFamilies."
2664,Adam Schiff,"But if curbing cyber theft is a journey of a thousand miles, perhaps China has taken a first step. #ChinaCyber"
2665,Adam Schiff,...on Chinese businesses that continue to profit from the theft of American research and development.
2666,Adam Schiff,I remain skeptical that China will deliver on this promise and believe it will be necessary to impose a series of increasing consequences...
2667,Adam Schiff,"No nation has done more to advance economic interests through theft of work product than China, at tremendous cost to U.S. businesses &amp; jobs"
2668,Adam Schiff,President Xi’s commitment to neither conduct nor support cyber espionage for commercial gain is long overdue.
2669,Adam Schiff,Deeply disturbed by artillery shelling &amp; ceasefire violation by Azerbaijan that killed 3 Armenian women. US needs to condemn Azeri brutality
2670,Adam Schiff,New speaker will not solve GOP conference's problems without real commitment by the majority party to meet the responsibility of governing.
2671,Adam Schiff,Speaker Boehner is inherently decent man who cares deeply about institution of Congress. Resignation is sad commentary on dysfunction of GOP

2675,Adam Schiff,"..who has used his pulpit to encourage action on the issues that truly matter, informed by nothing other than his faith &amp; communion with God"

2689,Adam Schiff,"But sadly, Congress has not only failed to reform 2001 AUMF, but also refused to take up a new AUMF authorizing ongoing war against ISIS."
2690,Adam Schiff,"For years, I've worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to sunset and replace this outdated authorization. #AUMF"
2691,Adam Schiff,"...and that it would be relied upon to wage war against terrorist organization, ISIS, not in existence in 2001 &amp; often at war with Al Qaeda."

2738,Adam Schiff,"There are other elements of the #IranDeal that are concerning, even deeply concerning..."
2739,Adam Schiff,"In #IranDeal, our unilateral ability to snap back whole range of sanctions &amp; intrusive nature of inspections are key."
2740,Adam Schiff,"As one would expect in any negotiation with a bitter adversary, some elements of the deal turned out well, others less so. #IranDeal"
2741,Adam Schiff,"#IranDeal realistically precludes Iran from developing an atomic bomb for 15 or more years, and does so while reducing the chances of war."

2782,Adam Schiff,These are the stakes and our decision should be made with sober thought and a minimum of partisan demagoguery. #IranDeal
2783,Adam Schiff,"Will rejection of the deal lead to additional sanctions and an Iran willing to concede more, or to renewed enrichment and a path to war?"
2784,Adam Schiff,"If agreement is flawed it should be rejected; at same time, we must not compare proposal to an ideal, but rather to any credible alternative"
2785,Adam Schiff,"As terms &amp; consequences of agreement become clear, I would urge my colleagues in Congress to give measure the serious thought it deserves."
2786,Adam Schiff,"...to project its destructive influence, we cannot be too careful, nor can we afford to take Tehran at its word."
2787,Adam Schiff,Given Iran's long record of duplicity and the consequence of Iran's getting a bomb or having a greater economic power ...
2788,Adam Schiff,I will also be examining any relaxation of UN sanctions on Iran's acquisition of weapons or missile technology.

2792,Adam Schiff,"These are the so-called ""snap back"" provisions... should Tehran fail to meet its commitments."
2793,Adam Schiff,I will also be looking at the sequencing of Iranian actions and any loosening of sanctions and the mechanism for re-imposing them...
2794,Adam Schiff,It will also be necessary for the United States &amp; our partners to get an accurate accounting of Tehran's nuclear program from its inception.
2795,Adam Schiff,"...and whether we have timely access to any site of Iran's potential nuclear development activities, including venues controlled by military"
2796,Adam Schiff,Whether I can support the agreement will hinge on our ability to verify that Iran is complying...
2797,Adam Schiff,with particular attention to the verification regime that is central to ensuring that Iran cannot cheat. #IranDeal
2798,Adam Schiff,In the coming days I will be examining the terms of the agreement hammered out by Secretary Of State John Kerry and his team...
2799,Adam Schiff,This raised costs of Iran's enrichment program &amp; helped dry up portion of funding Iran used to carry out its nefarious conduct in region.
2800,Adam Schiff,"To accomplish this, I supported a series of ever tightening American sanctions &amp; efforts to rally international community to isolate Iran."

2809,Adam Schiff,"In the weeks and months ahead, it is clear that much more work will be needed to safeguard our networks..."
2810,Adam Schiff,But that we need to take responsibility for the protection of personal information that is so obvious a target.
2811,Adam Schiff,This change in leadership is also an acknowledgement that we cannot simply place blame on the hackers
2812,Adam Schiff,OPM not only poorly defended sensitive data of millions of Americans but struggled to respond to repeated intrusions.

2816,Adam Schiff,I do not believe OPM was fully candid in its original briefing to the Committee and omitted key information about two distinct hacks.
2817,Adam Schiff,I have been deeply disturbed by the information Members of the Intelligence Committee received from OPM since the disclosure of these hacks.
2818,Adam Schiff,"Addressing this problem must begin by acknowledging that it is our responsibility to protect our people, most personal information &amp; privacy"
2819,Adam Schiff,Many of these employees are entrusted with critical national security missions.
2820,Adam Schiff,"Plainly, we need to do so much more to safeguard our networks, especially those which hold most sensitive details about Government employees"
2821,Adam Schiff,"Rather than simply place blame on hackers, we need to acknowledge our own culpability in failing to adequately protect so obvious a target."
2822,Adam Schiff,Today’s announcement by the Office of Personnel Management makes public the appalling severity of these cyber intrusions. #OPMHack

2848,Adam Schiff,"As members of Al Qaeda leadership have been captured or killed, Zawahiri has been increasingly reliant on a small cadre of loyal lieutenants"
2849,Adam Schiff,Death of Nasir al-Wuhayshi – leader of AQAP &amp; #2 to Ayman Al Zawahiri – is significant blow to core Al Qaeda &amp; its most dangerous franchise.

2854,Adam Schiff,"Congressional abdication of our responsibility to declare war, or to deny authorization for war, sets a terrible precedent."
2855,Adam Schiff,"While our pilots and special forces risk it all, Congress refuses to do its job and pass an #AUMF to fight ISIS."

2877,Adam Schiff,"While positive Senate joined House in embracing #USAFreedom, unfortunate they didn't do so in time to avoid the interruption of NatSec tools"
2878,Adam Schiff,"Tonight, politics overtook good sense in Senate. #NSAReform"

2885,Adam Schiff,"The reality is that we wait only for the courage to act, and that is not something that can be delivered by pouch from the White House #AUMF"

2890,Adam Schiff,Will be on @CNNsotu tomorrow to discuss operation against Abu Sayyaf with @brikeilarcnn at 9 am EST/6 am PST and 12 pm EST/9 am PST.
2891,Adam Schiff,"ISIS, like Al Qaeda, has proven adept at replacing its commanders and we will need to keep up the pressure on its leadership and financing."
2892,Adam Schiff,"Sayyaf's loss &amp; other senior leadership is setback to ISIS, but we're under no illusion about long-term impacts of any particular operation."

2894,Adam Schiff,Willingness to mount an effort to capture Abu Sayyaf underscores importance of cutting off ISIS resources &amp; Admin's determination to do so.
2895,Adam Schiff,Thanks to brave US personnel who carried out operation against Abu Sayyaf. There are serious risks to our troops with any operation in Syria
2896,Adam Schiff,"Even now, some in the railroad industry &amp; in Congress have been trying to delay implementation of Positive Train Control across the country."
2897,Adam Schiff,The tragic #Amtrak188 accident this week reminds us again of the terrible price we pay for delay of implementing Positive Train Control.
2898,Adam Schiff,The overwhelming support for #USAFreedomAct shows Senate that straight re-authorization of Section 215 is nonstarter http://t.co/ixW3NU7huf
2899,Adam Schiff,Passage of #USAFreedomAct with a strong bipartisan vote is important step forward in reforming surveillance programs http://t.co/ixW3NU7huf
