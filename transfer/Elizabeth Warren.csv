0,Elizabeth Warren,"20 years ago, the @WorcesterFD courageously ran into a burning warehouse, &amp; six brave firefighters didn’t make it out. Today we honor the Worcester 6, &amp; we remember the sacrifice that all our firefighters make to keep us safe every day. #W6"
1,Elizabeth Warren,"For far too long, big corporations have taken advantage of part-time workers with unpredictable work schedules – creating real hardships for them. My bill with @RepSchakowsky strengthens the rights, stability, &amp; other protections workers deserve to build better financial futures."
2,Elizabeth Warren,The Part-Time Worker Bill of Rights Act would:❌ Require big companies to offer available hours to part-time employees before hiring new employees/subcontractors❌ Make more part-time employees eligible for FMLA❌ Give part-time workers access to pension plans
3,Elizabeth Warren,2/3 of part-time retail &amp; food workers want full-time work – but corporations often keep workers part-time to save on wages &amp; benefits. @RepSchakowsky &amp; I are introducing the Part-Time Worker Bill of Rights Act to boost protections for part-time workers.
4,Elizabeth Warren,"All workers, including Harvard grad students, should have the right to organize &amp; fight for better wages &amp; working conditions. I've joined the entire MA delegation in urging Harvard’s leadership to negotiate in good faith with @hgsuuaw for a fair agreement."
5,Elizabeth Warren,"Retail, fast food, &amp; other hourly workers deserve some basic fairness when it comes to scheduling shifts. That’s why my #SchedulesThatWork Act with @rosadelauro would end some of the very worst abuses that hurt workers &amp; families. #FairWorkWeek"
6,Elizabeth Warren,"Holtec shouldn't be exempt from important emergency prep safeguards as it decommissions the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station. The community has rightly raised important questions about the plant's decommissioning. They deserve answers, not more strong-arming."
7,Elizabeth Warren,"US military hardware in the hands of armed groups in Yemen violates US law &amp; undermines our security. Glad that @StateDept &amp; @DeptofDefense are investigating, but Saudi &amp; UAE govts aren’t fully cooperating. I still think selling them arms is a bad idea."
8,Elizabeth Warren,"President Trump's trade-war-by-tweet with China is hurting cranberry farmers in MA &amp; across the country. @SenMarkey, @USRepKeating, @RepJoeKennedy &amp; I are urging the @USTradeRep to find new markets to compensate for China’s 40% tariffs on US cranberries."
9,Elizabeth Warren,"This month, my POW/MIA Flag Act became law. Starting this week, you’ll see this Flag flying with the US flag over the Capitol permanently. This symbol must now be displayed daily at many federal sites across the nation so we never forget our servicemembers who didn’t return home."
10,Elizabeth Warren,"Working families deserve a @CFPB that will get the tricks &amp; traps out of credit cards &amp; other financial products – &amp; stand up to big banks, credit card &amp; fintech companies when they cheat &amp; discriminate. I’ll keep fighting to hold the CFPB accountable until it does its job."
11,Elizabeth Warren,"In the 2 yrs they’ve controlled @CFPB, @MickMulvaneyOMB &amp; @CFPBDirector have gutted its fair lending office, stripped it of exam &amp; enforcement powers, &amp; failed to file even 1 equal credit enforcement action. Could it be that banks know they can discriminate without consequences?"
12,Elizabeth Warren,.@CFPB’s job is to enforce fair lending laws &amp; stop discriminatory financial products. @SenSherrodBrown &amp; I want @CFPBDirector to explain how @GoldmanSachs’ @Apple Card slipped through when women who apply may get worse terms than men with similar credit.
13,Elizabeth Warren,"Our hearts go out to the crew of the F/V Leonardo, their loved ones, &amp; to our entire fishing community in New Bedford. Fishing is more than a job or industry in MA – it's a family. We're grateful for the @USCG's tireless work today &amp; every day."
14,Elizabeth Warren,"On International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, let’s reaffirm our commitment to ensuring women &amp; girls worldwide can live free from violence. The US can show leadership by reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. #OrangeTheWorld #VAWA4ALL"
15,Elizabeth Warren,"Congrats to Boston Battery Wharf Hotel workers &amp; @UNITEHERE26 for ratifying a new contract for better pay, affordable health care, fair scheduling, &amp; protections from sexual harassment &amp; discrimination. It was a tough fight – but when workers fight, workers win."
16,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenMarkey &amp; I are proud to see @EnergyCommerce pass our Leonel Rondon Pipeline Safety Act with @RepLoriTrahan as part of their SAFER Pipelines Act – &amp; we’re grateful for good neighbors like @RepAnnieKuster who fight to help keep the Merrimack Valley &amp; all our communities safe.
17,Elizabeth Warren,Access to millions of patient records gives @Google a huge resource to build AI systems &amp; other tech – especially in light of news that Google is trying to buy Fitbit. Regulators &amp; medical experts are right to have big privacy &amp; competition concerns.
18,Elizabeth Warren,"Medical records are extremely sensitive info that, when mishandled, expose patients to embarrassment, discrimination, &amp; exploitation. Based on @Google’s prior privacy violations &amp; security failures, we need to know how they’re handling patient data &amp; for what purposes."
19,Elizabeth Warren,"I'm concerned by reports that @Google collected personal health information from 50 million Americans without their consent. @SenBlumenthal, @SenBillCassidy &amp; I want Google to explain “Project Nightingale” &amp; how they’re planning to use this private data."
20,Elizabeth Warren,"In the past decade, the @FederalReserve hasn’t denied a single bank merger application. It’s clear: the Fed works for the big, rich banks – and everyone else pays the price. Earlier this year, I told Chairman Powell: that needs to change."
21,Elizabeth Warren,The last thing our country needs is more Too Big To Fail banks. They put our entire economy – and working families – at risk.
22,Elizabeth Warren,Everyone has a right to live in a safe &amp; affordable home. I’m glad to join @NydiaVelazquez’s bold effort to invest $70B in the Public Housing Capital Fund to wipe out the backlog of public housing maintenance &amp; repairs caused by years of underfunding.
23,Elizabeth Warren,"Glad the #HongKongHumanRightsDemocracyAct passed the Senate. I’m proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, which strengthens support for human rights &amp; democracy in Hong Kong."
24,Elizabeth Warren,I’m concerned about private equity firms' investment in industries like nursing homes that care for seniors &amp; people with disabilities &amp; rely on government Medicaid &amp; Medicare funding. That’s why I’ve got a bill to #StopWallStreetLooting &amp; hold private equity firms accountable.
25,Elizabeth Warren,For-profit nursing home chains owned by private equity firms have more health &amp; safety problems that put residents at risk. And the complicated ownership structure makes it hard for families to hold these homes legally liable for bad care.  #StopWallStreetLooting
26,Elizabeth Warren,"Private equity firms have made big investments in big for-profit nursing home chains. @SenSherrodBrown, @RepMarkPocan &amp; I are investigating their role in the declining quality of nursing home care. #StopWallStreetLooting"
27,Elizabeth Warren,"Sorry for interrupting the party, @HHSGov – but before we spend more money to hang his portrait, can we get answers to our questions about whether Tom Price paid back taxpayers for his wrongful use of private jets on the taxpayer’s dime? https://t.co/6eziMyn1Fv"
28,Elizabeth Warren,"Here’s the bottom line: private equity firms are putting millions of workers at risk by loading up companies with debt, stripping assets, &amp; collecting huge fees. If the bets go bad, they walk away. I’ll keep fighting to #StopWallStreetLooting &amp; hold private equity accountable."
29,Elizabeth Warren,"Ernst &amp; Young’s industry-funded report paints a dishonest picture about private equity's effect on our economy. For example, when EY calculated private equity-owned companies’ avg wages, they included their Wall Street investors’ fat paychecks to skew the numbers."
30,Elizabeth Warren,"Private equity will do anything to kill my #StopWallStreetLooting Act – even funding a sham study by Ernst &amp; Young to defend the industry. @RepMarkPocan, @RepJayapal, @SenatorBaldwin, @SenSanders, &amp; I want EY to explain their report's glaring flaws."
31,Elizabeth Warren,"Toys “R” Us. Radio Shack. Payless Shoes. Sports Authority. Mervyn’s. Shopko. For far too long, private equity firms have destroyed retail stores &amp; killed jobs, hurt workers, &amp; drained our economy. We must #StopWallStreetLooting – &amp; I have a bill for that."
32,Elizabeth Warren,Devastating – and unacceptable. It's time for the @SenateGOP to stop working for the gun industry and start taking action to protect our children from senseless gun violence.
33,Elizabeth Warren,It’s true: our student loan system IS fundamentally broken. That’s why @WhipClyburn &amp; I have a bill to cancel student loan debt for 42 million Americans. Our bill will help close the racial wealth gap &amp; end the student debt crisis. #CancelMyDebt
34,Elizabeth Warren,"Dr. Johnson says that “repayment trends suggest much of the [student loan] debt will likely never be repaid,” but @BetsyDeVosED refuses to lift a finger to help our students. If @usedgov is sitting on info confirming Dr. Johnson's conclusions, the public deserves to see it."
35,Elizabeth Warren,"Last month, one of @BetsyDeVosED’s top student loan advisors abruptly resigned, called the student loan system “fundamentally broken,” &amp; announced his support for student debt cancellation. @WhipClyburn &amp; I want to know how he came to that conclusion."
36,Elizabeth Warren,MA residents want clean air &amp; water &amp; safety for their communities. They don’t want Big Oil &amp; Gas swooping in to turn a profit by shipping natural gas overseas. I’ll keep fighting alongside South Shore families to keep a compressor station out of Weymouth.
37,Elizabeth Warren,"Our brave firefighters risk their lives every day to keep us safe, &amp; it’s a tragedy when someone doesn’t make it home to their loved ones. My heart goes out to Lt. Menard’s family &amp; friends, &amp; the entire @WorcesterFD for their loss."
38,Elizabeth Warren,Valeria &amp; her sister are woven into the fabric of our Commonwealth &amp; our country. Their #HomeIsHere. I stand with our DACA recipients at the Supreme Court – and all of our Dreamers – who are fighting for the chance to build a future for themselves &amp; their families. #HereToStay
39,Elizabeth Warren,"Last week, I partnered with my colleagues on a bipartisan resolution urging the @USPS to commemorate some of the most courageous women veterans in our nation's history with a postage stamp series. It's one way we can honor their hard work &amp; dedication."
40,Elizabeth Warren,"All 3 of my brothers served in the military, &amp; I appreciate the sacrifices &amp; contributions that our servicemembers, veterans, &amp; military families make for our country. We are grateful for their service – on #VeteransDay &amp; every day."
41,Elizabeth Warren,I’ve worked hard in the Senate to improve the lives of our veterans &amp; military families. I co-led a bipartisan bill to streamline the process for veterans to get commercial driver’s licenses. I’m glad it was signed into law last year.
42,Elizabeth Warren,"Welcome back to Massachusetts, Ambassador @SenScottBrown and Gail! I know it will be good for New England Law Boston to have a dynamic leader."
43,Elizabeth Warren,"All 3 of my brothers came home safe after their service, but many do not. My bipartisan bill signed into law this week ensures that the POW/MIA Flag is prominently displayed &amp; that we never forget our servicemembers who haven’t returned home."
44,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenatorMenendez issued a report showing the Trump administration recklessly ignored the warnings of career @StateDept officials about ending humanitarian protections for TPS recipients from El Salvador, Honduras, &amp; Haiti. More proof of this administration's heartless policies."
45,Elizabeth Warren,"This is disgusting. Eric Blankenstein’s racist writings disqualify him from a job at @HUDgov or any other government agency. He should have been fired, not rewarded with a big promotion."
46,Elizabeth Warren,"Like a lot of parents in MA &amp; across the country, I struggled as a young mom to find &amp; afford quality child care. Today it’s even harder. I’m fighting for #UniversalChildCare so every family can afford care &amp; child care workers are paid what they deserve."
47,Elizabeth Warren,"Last month, I wrote a letter to the @StateDept &amp; @DeptofDefense asking whether continuing to sell our military hardware to the Saudis &amp; Emiratis is a good idea. (Hint: it’s not.)"
48,Elizabeth Warren,Step 1: Saudis transfer U.S. military equipment to Yemen.Step 2: UAE-backed separatist militia gets that equipment &amp; uses it against Saudi-backed govt. Step 3: Saudis keep transferring more U.S. military equipment to Yemen. What could go wrong?
49,Elizabeth Warren,"Before the @FCC approved the deal, T-Mobile execs spent $195k at Trump Hotels. This is what corruption looks like, &amp; working families pay the price. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would reduce the stranglehold that giant companies have over our government."
50,Elizabeth Warren,"The US has a monopoly problem. In industry after industry, giant corporations get to play by their own political &amp; economic rules, amassing unchecked power over people’s lives. And our government regulators would rather kiss up to them than use their tools to uphold the law."
51,Elizabeth Warren,"The @FCC’s final approval of the T-Mobile/Sprint merger officially hands control of nearly 100% of wireless services to 3 corporate giants – strangling competition &amp; harming consumers, workers, &amp; small businesses."
52,Elizabeth Warren,"Drug breakthroughs don’t happen by magic – they’re the result of generations of taxpayer investments. But in 2018, @NIH could only fund 20% of its research apps. The Medical Innovation Act is a powerful way to invest in the basic research that will save lives. #NIHSwearJar"
53,Elizabeth Warren,"My bill requires giant drug companies that produce billion-dollar drugs &amp; enter federal settlements to reinvest a portion of their profits in @NIH research as a condition of the settlement. I call it the #NIHSwearJar: if a drug company follows the rules, it won't pay the fee."
54,Elizabeth Warren,Giant drug companies caught breaking the law often get off with slap-on-the-wrist settlements. I’m reintroducing my Medical Innovation Act with @PeterWelch to increase @NIH &amp; @US_FDA research funding by holding big pharma accountable. #NIHSwearJar
55,Elizabeth Warren,"This is disgraceful. Federal funding for Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities expired more than a month ago, &amp; @SenAlexander just rejected the #FUTUREAct to restore this critical funding. Again. Senate Republicans need to stop the games &amp; fund our HBCUs &amp; MSIs NOW."
56,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump’s withdrawal from the #ParisAgreement is a giant wet kiss to corporate polluters. I’m a cosponsor of @SenatorShaheen’s bill to stop President Trump’s withdrawal. The @SenateGOP should give that bill a vote.
57,Elizabeth Warren,I’m glad to work with @RosaDeLauro on the #SchedulesThatWork Act to help workers build some economic security for themselves &amp; their families.
58,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m especially proud to recognize Deborah Sampson from Plympton, MA, who disguised herself as a man to fight in the Revolutionary War &amp; was the only woman to earn a Revolutionary Army military pension. Women veterans like Deborah Sampson should be honored for their service."
59,Elizabeth Warren,"Women veterans are tough, smart, &amp; have made incredible sacrifices for our country. I’m leading a bipartisan resolution with @LisaMurkowski, @SenMcSallyAZ, &amp; @SenatorTester urging the @USPS to issue a postage stamp series commemorating historic women vets."
60,Elizabeth Warren,"The Trump administration will admit the lowest number of refugees ever – it’s heartless &amp; wrong. We can admit vulnerable populations fleeing persecution &amp; violence while keeping our country secure, healthy &amp; prosperous. It’s not an either/or proposition."
61,Elizabeth Warren,"My office found that a sanctioned Russian company with Putin ties received a tariff exemption, &amp; most exemptions go to foreign-owned companies. The tariff exclusion process is one more way the Trump admin works for big, well-connected, &amp; in many cases, foreign-owned companies."
62,Elizabeth Warren,"The @CommerceOIG report concluded: the Trump administration’s process for reviewing steel &amp; aluminum tariff exemptions “is neither transparent nor objective.” In fact, the decisions “give the appearance that the Department officials may not be impartial.”"
63,Elizabeth Warren,"Starting last August, I asked the @CommerceOIG to investigate @CommerceGov’s seemingly arbitrary &amp; opaque process for exempting companies from Trump’s steel &amp; aluminum tariffs. Their new report back confirms: the process was rigged from the start."
64,Elizabeth Warren,I’m grateful for @Pwr4PuertoRico’s support of my bill to give Puerto Rico &amp; other disaster-stricken US territories a route to comprehensive debt relief &amp; a chance to get back on their feet. It’s time for Congress to pass this bill.
65,Elizabeth Warren,"Steven Menashi worked with @BetsyDeVosED to gut civil rights &amp; consumer protections for students while at Trump’s Education Department, &amp; @realDonaldTrump has rewarded him with a nomination to be a federal judge. The Senate should reject him. #StopMenashi"
66,Elizabeth Warren,I agree with @RepDebHaaland: the Chaco region is sacred &amp; must be protected for future generations. I’ve supported legislation in the Senate to do that. The House should pass the Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act today. #ProtectChaco #ProtectTheSacred
67,Elizabeth Warren,I join the Armenian American community in MA &amp; the rest of the Armenian diaspora in celebrating the House passage of a resolution recognizing the #ArmenianGenocide. I cosponsored S.Res.150 to recognize this tragedy. The Senate should pass it now.
68,Elizabeth Warren,"Sec. @stevenmnuchin1, you don’t work for Jamie Dimon &amp; your Wall St buddies – you work for the American people. Do your job to protect our economy, explain what went wrong in the markets, &amp; stop looking for excuses to roll back rules that help prevent another financial crisis."
69,Elizabeth Warren,"Unbelievable. Former big bank executive turned @USTreasury Secretary @stevenmnuchin1 hasn’t even offered an explanation for the recent overnight lending rate spike, but he’s already using it as an excuse to weaken the rules on giant Wall Street banks."
70,Elizabeth Warren,"The fossil fuel industry &amp; their allies use armies of lawyers, lobbyists, front groups, &amp; trade associations to rig the rules for dirty polluters. Tune in now to watch the @SenDemsClimate hearing on how dark money is blocking action on the #ClimateCrisis."
71,Elizabeth Warren,"Congrats to our Dedham teachers for voting to ratify a new contract yesterday after courageously going on strike. In MA &amp; all across this country, teachers are fighting back &amp; making their voices heard – &amp; they’re winning. That’s how we make real change."
72,Elizabeth Warren,"Kay Hagan was a kind &amp; passionate public servant who fought from the heart for women, children, servicemembers, &amp; working people in NC &amp; across the country. My thoughts are with her husband Chip, their children &amp; family, &amp; the people of North Carolina."
73,Elizabeth Warren,"First responders in MA &amp; across the country go above &amp; beyond to save lives, keep us safe, &amp; help our communities rebuild. I’m proud to have led the bipartisan Senate resolution to honor first responders’ service &amp; sacrifices by designating today as #FirstRespondersDay."
74,Elizabeth Warren,"The @USArmy’s report suggests ways it can combat the #ClimateCrisis: reduce carbon emissions, invest in more research to be energy resilient, &amp; budget for climate risks. The @DeptofDefense must do more to adapt to climate change, &amp; I have a bill for that."
75,Elizabeth Warren,"A @USArmy report says the climate crisis will cause more frequent power outages, reduced access to water &amp; food, mass migration, disease outbreaks &amp; a greater chance of armed conflict. In other words, climate change is a public health &amp; ntl security risk."
76,Elizabeth Warren,"This Prescription Drug #TakeBackDay, dropoff centers are also accepting e-cigarettes &amp; vaping products to help fight the epidemic of youth tobacco use. Find a location near you:"
77,Elizabeth Warren,Millions of people get their wisdom teeth taken out or have minor surgery &amp; don’t use all the painkillers prescribed to them. Help fight the opioid epidemic by safely disposing any unused opioids in your medicine cabinet at a drop off location today:
78,Elizabeth Warren,Taxpayers shouldn’t have to pay a heartless billionaire’s court fines for further punishing defrauded students. @BetsyDeVosED should be held personally accountable for violating court orders &amp; breaking the law.
79,Elizabeth Warren,Secretary @BetsyDeVosED deserves to be held in contempt for violating a court order to stop collecting Corinthian students’ debt. But let’s be clear: a $100k fine paid for by @usedgov punishes taxpayers – not DeVos herself.
80,Elizabeth Warren,"I stand with our Dedham teachers who are courageously striking today for a fair contract with better pay. When teachers succeed, our children succeed."
81,Elizabeth Warren,"Today our Senate office paid our respects to our friend and champion @RepCummings, who laid in state in the United States Capitol. His legacy of service befits this historic honor, &amp; his powerful voice will never be forgotten in these halls."
82,Elizabeth Warren,"14 months after the @OIGatHHS recommended that @HHSgov recover at least $341,000 in taxpayer dollars that former Secretary Tom Price wasted on lavish travel, there’s no evidence HHS has done so. @PattyMurray, @RonWyden &amp; I want answers."
83,Elizabeth Warren,Amazon Web Services knew – or should have known – that its servers used by @CapitalOne were vulnerable to SSRF attacks. @RonWyden &amp; I want the @FTC to investigate whether @awscloud’s role in the data theft of 100M Capital One customers broke federal law.
84,Elizabeth Warren,"Gwen Ifill was a talented journalist, a trailblazer for women of color, &amp; the pride of @SimmonsUniv &amp; Classical High School in Springfield, MA. I’m glad to see that she will be honored with a @USPS postage stamp next year."
85,Elizabeth Warren,For-profit colleges suck down taxpayer dollars as they load students up with debt for worthless degrees. I support the #StudentsNotProfits Act with @SenSherrodBrown &amp; @RepJayapal to finally end this corruption &amp; stop subsidizing for-profit colleges’ scams.
86,Elizabeth Warren,I’ve spent years fighting side-by-side with our fearless @MassAGO Maura Healey to help MA students scammed by Corinthian Colleges. And we're going to stay in this fight until @BetsyDeVosED &amp; @usedgov follow the law &amp; cancel every last Corinthian student’s loans.
87,Elizabeth Warren,I’m concerned that big banks are using short-term lending market volatility to pressure regulators to weaken the financial rules that protect our economy. @StevenMnuchin1 should explain why the govt needed to step in for the 1st time since the 2008 crisis.
88,Elizabeth Warren,My bill to #StopWallStreetLooting would hold private equity firms responsible for their companies – including in the health industry. And Congress should pass #MedicareForAll so nobody goes broke paying a medical bill that pads the pockets of insurance execs &amp; Wall St bankers.
89,Elizabeth Warren,"Almost 2/3 of US hospitals outsource physician staffing, many to companies owned by private equity firms. @RepMarkPocan, @RepLloydDoggett &amp; I want to know more about the role those firms play in the sharp rise in surprise out-of-network medical bills."
90,Elizabeth Warren,"Nobody having a heart attack or stroke picks their ambulance or ER doc. But when a hospital outsources its physician staffing or ambulance services to a private-equity-owned company, patients can get stuck with outrageous medical bills. It's obscene."
91,Elizabeth Warren,"Sec. @BetsyDeVosED has given a free pass to every swindler &amp; crook trying to make a buck off America’s students &amp; teachers. Now she’s choking the program designed to help keep teachers from getting crushed by decades of debt. I'll say it again, Sec. DeVos: do your job or resign."
92,Elizabeth Warren,I’ll give you one guess who’s responsible for obstructing student debt relief for teachers &amp; other public servants. (Hint: it’s the Secretary of Education who doesn’t believe in public education.)
93,Elizabeth Warren,"But most borrowers never got the help. Last month, @USGAO reported @usedgov is STILL rejecting 99% of Temporary Expanded PSLF applications. The Trump admin has only spent 3.8% of the emergency funding Congress set aside to help public service borrowers."
94,Elizabeth Warren,I’ve been fighting to fix the PSLF problem from the moment I heard about it – &amp; I led the expansion of PSLF funding by $700 million over 2 years to forgive the student loan balances of people caught in this mess &amp; enrolled in the wrong program.
95,Elizabeth Warren,"Starting in 2007, our country made a promise to public servants: pay your student loans for 10 years &amp; the balance would be wiped out. But as the 10-year point hit, people who thought they were enrolled in PSLF discovered they weren’t. It’s a nightmare."
96,Elizabeth Warren,Secretary @BetsyDeVosED &amp; the Trump admin wrecked the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program for teachers &amp; other public servants. @usedgov needs to explain why borrowers aren’t getting the help Congress made available &amp; how they're planning to fix this.
97,Elizabeth Warren,"This is simple: if @Navient knows that @usedgov is too scared or captured to punish it for cheating students, then guess what? It’s going to keep cheating students while @BetsyDeVosED blocks &amp; tackles for them. It’s time to finally end this cycle &amp; #FireNavient."
98,Elizabeth Warren,@Navient @usedgov New evidence from a @CFPB lawsuit shows @Navient officials knew it was scamming students &amp; didn't stop it. @SenBlumenthal &amp; I told @BetsyDeVosED &amp; @usedgov they have no excuse: they can't throw more taxpayer money at Navient &amp; renew their $200M contract.
99,Elizabeth Warren,"Student loan giant @Navient (formerly Sallie Mae) has a history of cheating students &amp; taxpayers more than a decade long. For years, I’ve pushed Republicans AND Democrats at @usedgov to hold Navient accountable, but the dept basically told me Navient is ""Too Big to Fail."""
100,Elizabeth Warren,Good luck to everyone participating in the Head of the Charles this weekend! And special thanks to all of the volunteers &amp; organizers who make this weekend so special for all of us in MA &amp; our visitors from across the country &amp; around the world. #HOCR55
101,Elizabeth Warren,Transgender migrants &amp; asylum seekers have faced appalling abuse &amp; neglect. @SenatorBaldwin &amp; I are calling on the Trump administration to reverse policies that are harming these vulnerable populations.
102,Elizabeth Warren,"Happy birthday, Old Ironsides &amp; the @USNavy! It’s an honor to have our country’s oldest commissioned ship in the Charlestown Navy Yard every day – but especially today."
103,Elizabeth Warren,"Workers of color – especially women – are more likely to have unpredictable work schedules, face cancelled shifts, work consecutive closing &amp; opening shifts, &amp; be part-time workers. #SchedulesThatWork is about basic dignity &amp; fairness for all workers."
104,Elizabeth Warren,@rosadelauro The #SchedulesThatWork Act would set some ground rules for workers’ schedules:🗓️ Workers should get their schedule 2 weeks in advance🗓️ No retaliation against workers who ask for schedule changes🗓️ Workers have a right to rest between shifts
105,Elizabeth Warren,"More than half of hourly workers get their work schedules with less than a week’s notice, making it tough to go to school, keep child care, &amp; pay the bills. I’m reintroducing the #SchedulesThatWork Act with @RosaDeLauro for some economic security for working families."
106,Elizabeth Warren,"Instead of strengthening anti-discrimination rules to protect homeowners &amp; renters, @HUDgov is trying to make it nearly impossible for families of color to fight back against lenders &amp; landlords. Read my op-ed on why all of us should be in this fight."
107,Elizabeth Warren,"Whenever anyone would ask @RepCummings why we should keep fighting, even when the odds were against us, he’d always say: “We don’t have the right to be silent.” We honor his memory by staying in the fight and keeping his hope alive. Rest in power, Elijah."
108,Elizabeth Warren,".@RepCummings was a fearless leader for social, economic, &amp; racial justice, a giant for the people of Baltimore, &amp; my dear friend &amp; longtime partner. Sending my love to his beloved wife Maya, his children, his incredible staff, &amp; everyone mourning the loss of our champion."
109,Elizabeth Warren,Government can be a powerful force for good – but only when it works for the people. It’s time to end lobbying as we know it &amp; padlock the revolving door between our government &amp; giant corporations. And I’ve got a bill for that. #endcorruptionnow
110,Elizabeth Warren,"For most of America’s history, when our companies did better, our workers did better – and America built a thriving middle class. The Accountable Capitalism Act will help realign our skewed market incentives so companies &amp; workers can once again do well together."
111,Elizabeth Warren,"181 CEOs signed a @BizRoundtable non-binding pledge to account for workers &amp; consumers in their decisions. I’m urging companies like @Amazon, @Walmart, @GM, @JPMorgan, @ATT, &amp; @Comcast to keep that promise by supporting our Accountable Capitalism reforms."
112,Elizabeth Warren,"It also requires billion-dollar companies to obtain a federal charter requiring directors to consider the interests of ALL their stakeholders, including employees, customers, &amp; their communities. That charter can be revoked if a company has egregious &amp; repeated illegal conduct."
113,Elizabeth Warren,"The Accountable Capitalism Act holds businesses accountable to their employees, not just shareholders:✅Requires workers to elect 40% of board ✅Restricts board &amp; execs’ company stock sales✅Requires 75% of execs &amp; shareholders' approval for political expenditures"
114,Elizabeth Warren,"Year after year, corporate profits soar for executives &amp; shareholders – but workers’ wages barely budge. I’m reintroducing my Accountable Capitalism Act with @repbenraylujan to empower workers &amp; help fix this fundamental problem with our economy."
115,Elizabeth Warren,"I worked with @RepPressley, @SenMarkey, &amp; more than 100 colleagues to push @USCIS to reverse its decision to end some deferred action, including for sick children. Thanks, @RepCummings, for working to get answers about the Trump administration’s cruel, immoral decision."
116,Elizabeth Warren,Happy National #ComingOutDay! I’ll never stop fighting for a country where everyone feels safe to be who they are and love who they love.
117,Elizabeth Warren,"Glad to be a strong federal partner to build the roads, bridges, &amp; basic infrastructure we need to strengthen our economy &amp; protect public safety. We’re in this fight — shoulder to shoulder — all the way."
118,Elizabeth Warren,"A natural gas compressor station in Weymouth could be a health &amp; safety nightmare for South Shore families. @SenMarkey, @RepStephenLynch &amp; I urge @Enbridge to listen to the communities &amp; abandon their plans to build a compressor station in Massachusetts."
119,Elizabeth Warren,The student debt crisis will only get worse – especially for students of color – unless Congress steps up to solve it. I’m honored to work side-by-side with @WhipClyburn to tackle this crisis head-on. #cancelmydebt
120,Elizabeth Warren,"Black Americans face the worst effects of the student debt crisis. Many still owe more than 100% of their loan balance 12 years college, even with a degree in hand. My #cancelmydebt bill with @WhipClyburn takes meaningful steps to close the racial wealth gap."
121,Elizabeth Warren,I was delighted to join @WhipClyburn at his alma mater @SCSTATE1896 for a town hall on our bill to cancel student debt for 42 million Americans. #cancelmydebt
122,Elizabeth Warren,".@usedgov needs to follow the law &amp; cancel the student loans of scammed Corinthian Colleges students. And if @BetsyDeVosED wants to work for predatory for-profit colleges, she should resign &amp; find herself a new job."
123,Elizabeth Warren,"A federal judge was “astounded” by @BetsyDeVosED’s treatment of student borrowers. She said “At best it is gross negligence, at worst it’s an intentional flouting” of judicial orders to help students."
124,Elizabeth Warren,Secretary @BetsyDeVosED is such a failure at @usedgov that she may be held in contempt for refusing to follow the law &amp; stop punishing scammed students. Think about that: she'd rather risk sanctions or even jail than do her job to help America's students.
125,Elizabeth Warren,"Nobody fought harder to level the playing field for working people than my friend MarDee Xifaras. My heart goes out to her family, friends, &amp; the countless people touched by her wisdom, kindness, &amp; persistence. She will be deeply missed."
126,Elizabeth Warren,"In July, I joined @SenJeffMerkley &amp; my colleagues in Congress on an amicus brief in support of equal rights for LGBTQ employees. Nobody should face discrimination at work — or anywhere else — for who they are or who they love."
127,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m deeply grateful to Pleasant Hill Missionary Baptist Church &amp; my friend Rev. Miniard Culpepper for their dedication &amp; service to our communities in Boston. Congrats on your 80th anniversary, &amp; I look forward to celebrating many more milestones to come!"
128,Elizabeth Warren,"Congrats to @DanaFarber, @BrighamWomens &amp; @HarvardMed Dr. William Kaelin, Jr. for winning the @NobelPrize in Medicine. His groundbreaking work is a reminder of the importance of investing in medical research for the next big breakthrough to save lives."
129,Elizabeth Warren,"I joined my colleagues in Congress on an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in support of DACA. Dreamers are woven into the fabric of our country, &amp; they belong here. @realDonaldTrump was wrong – legally &amp; morally – to target this deeply important program."
130,Elizabeth Warren,The @CorpsNewEngland recommendation to replace the Sagamore &amp; Bourne Bridges is good news for the Cape &amp; Islands. Updating our infrastructure will help grow our economy &amp; enhance public safety. I’m committed to seeing this important project move forward.
131,Elizabeth Warren,"A year ago, the Saudi govt murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi. There’s been no punishment for those who ordered this crime &amp; the Trump admin ignores Congress's demands for accountability. We honor his memory by fighting for justice &amp; human rights."
132,Elizabeth Warren,My friend @SenSanders has always been a strong partner in the Senate. Wishing him a speedy recovery so he can get back in the fight.
133,Elizabeth Warren,I’m glad investors are speaking out on climate change. @SenWhitehouse is right: their companies shouldn't hide behind groups like @USChamber that rig rules for polluters. My Climate Risk Disclosure Act will help hold corporations accountable for their role in the #climatecrisis.
134,Elizabeth Warren,My #StopWallStreetLooting bill would hold private equity firms responsible for their companies. And we should abolish private prisons &amp; profit incentives that pervert the goal of our justice system.
135,Elizabeth Warren,"And the two largest private correctional medical care providers – both owned by private equity firms – have been sued about 1500 times over the past 5 years for “neglect, malpractice, and, in dozens of cases, wrongful injury or death.”"
136,Elizabeth Warren,"Privatization &amp; consolidation of prison food services means that private equity firms can make big bucks serving food with mold &amp; maggots – &amp; when incarcerated people decide to buy their own food, private equity profits off the commissaries. It’s all a racket."
137,Elizabeth Warren,"Private equity’s push into private prisons, detention centers, &amp; prison services companies has helped create monopolies that squeeze families. Think about it: when there’s no competition for prison phone services, a 15-minute call home can cost $25."
138,Elizabeth Warren,"Our criminal justice system lets private equity firms rake in billions at the expense of incarcerated people, detainees, their families, &amp; taxpayers. @RepMarkPocan, @RepAOC &amp; I are investigating private equity firms profiteering off prison services."
139,Elizabeth Warren,".@RepPressley, @RepAOC, &amp; @RepBarbaraLee are right: everyone is entitled to high quality reproductive health care, &amp; making that a reality starts with repealing the Hyde Amendment. #BeBoldEndHyde"
140,Elizabeth Warren,We can admit more refugees while keeping our country secure. I joined @SenJeffMerkley &amp; @SenMarkey to demand the Trump admin not slam the door on refugees. America should remain a beacon of hope to vulnerable families around the world.
141,Elizabeth Warren,The United States has long been a humanitarian leader by welcoming refugees fleeing persecution &amp; violence. But @realDonaldTrump slashed the number of refugees the US will accept to historic lows – &amp; now he’s cutting further. It's heartless &amp; wrong.
142,Elizabeth Warren,Historically black colleges &amp; universities can’t wait weeks or months for the @SenateGOP to fund their schools – and they shouldn’t be used as bargaining chips. @SenAlexander needs to stop the games &amp; fund our HBCUs &amp; other minority-serving colleges NOW.
143,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenMarkey, @RepLoriTrahan &amp; I are fighting to pass the Leonel Rondon Pipeline Safety Act so gas companies prioritize our communities’ safety. And we’re demanding answers from @ColumbiaGasMA &amp; @NiSourceInc on why they keep placing our residents &amp; first responders at risk."
144,Elizabeth Warren,"Just three days ago, the NTSB released a damning report that drew a direct link between weak engineering management at @NiSourceInc &amp; @ColumbiaGasMA &amp; last year’s devastating Merrimack Valley gas explosions."
145,Elizabeth Warren,"A major gas leak was reported in Lawrence, &amp; over 300 residents are being evacuated. We’re deeply grateful to Lawrence’s first responders &amp; Mayor @danrivera01843 for their quick action to keep residents safe."
146,Elizabeth Warren,"Cape Cod residents feel the #climatecrisis every day: erosion that threatens whole neighborhoods, a decimated fishing industry, &amp; superstorms that could devastate the region. Read the @BostonGlobe’s powerful new reporting on climate change on the Cape."
147,Elizabeth Warren,"11 people have contracted #EEE in MA &amp; 4 have died. @SenMarkey &amp; I have asked @NIAIDNews for an update on federal research into this rare mosquito-borne virus with no specific treatment, &amp; everyone in high-risk areas should take care to protect themselves &amp; their loved ones."
148,Elizabeth Warren,The President asked a foreign govt to interfere in our elections. White House officials tried to cover it up &amp; suppress this whistleblower. That’s a threat to our democracy. The House must do what the Constitution demands &amp; vote on articles of
149,Elizabeth Warren,"The President told a foreign govt to do him a favor &amp; work with his personal lawyer &amp; the AG to investigate a political opponent. Read the ""transcript."" For the safety &amp; integrity of our democracy, Congress must begin impeachment proceedings without delay."
150,Elizabeth Warren,"The workers at Fidelity House provide essential care to our friends, family, and neighbors in Lawrence. They shouldn’t have to live in poverty. I support the members of @SEIU509 as they fight for a fair contract with higher wages, #equalpay, and better working conditions."
151,Elizabeth Warren,I said it on the floor of the US Senate in May &amp; I’ll say it again: Congress must fulfill its Constitutional duty &amp; begin impeachment proceedings against the President. Nobody is above the law – not even the President of the United States.
152,Elizabeth Warren,"Title X has provided birth control, cancer screenings, HIV tests, &amp; other basic health care services to nearly 4 million Americans. The 9th Circuit should stop the Trump admin’s unlawful crusade to gut Title X &amp; control doctors &amp; patients. #SaveTitleX"
153,Elizabeth Warren,"“The Paycheck Fairness Act that the House passed is going to be a big step towards addressing the gender pay gap.” -@RepDavids@SenateMajLdr, help close the pay gap – especially for women of color – &amp; give that bill a vote. #NativeWomenEqualPayDay"
154,Elizabeth Warren,.@RepDebHaaland is right: “The fact that Native women only make 58 cents on the dollar compared to white men in similar positions is absolutely unacceptable.” #NativeWomenEqualPayDay
155,Elizabeth Warren,The fraud at @WellsFargo &amp; other giant banks won’t stop until executives like John Stumpf know that they’ll be hauled out in handcuffs for cheating customers. I’ve got a bill for that to hold Wall Street executives personally accountable when their banks break the law.
156,Elizabeth Warren,"Three years after that John Stumpf hearing, @WellsFargo is STILL scamming customers. I’m demanding answers from Wells Fargo &amp; our federal regulators about why these deep structural problems remain at the bank."
157,Elizabeth Warren,"Six days after we called on the @USOCC &amp; @CFPB to fire Tim Sloan, he stepped down as @WellsFargo’s CEO. I told Comptroller Otting to use his agency’s regulatory power to review Sloan’s successor, &amp; he agreed."
158,Elizabeth Warren,"Tim Sloan said the bank changed, but we weren’t fooled. @WellsFargo kept right on scamming its customers on mortgages, car loans, money laundering – too much to fit in a tweet. So @SenSherrodBrown &amp; I told the @CFPB &amp; @USOCC to use their power to fire him."
159,Elizabeth Warren,"Then I urged the new Fed Chair Jerome Powell to hold a public vote of the Federal Reserve Board before lifting @WellsFargo’s growth cap, &amp; he agreed."
160,Elizabeth Warren,"I also urged Janet Yellen to use her powers as Fed Chair to hold @WellsFargo accountable. In her final act as Fed Chair, she froze @WellsFargo’s growth until it cleaned up its act &amp; pushed out 4 of the board members responsible."
161,Elizabeth Warren,"When @WellsFargo replaced John Stumpf with Tim Sloan, another senior Wells Fargo executive during the fake accounts scandal, I told him to his face that he should be"
162,Elizabeth Warren,@WellsFargo John Stumpf’s hearing on the @WellsFargo fake accounts scandal was a powerful moment for Wall Street accountability. But let’s just be clear: it was just the start of our work to stop this fundamentally broken bank from scamming its customers.
163,Elizabeth Warren,"Three years ago today, I told @WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf that he should resign. (He did.)"
164,Elizabeth Warren,"Way to go, Boston! I’m proud of our students from across MA &amp; around the country for leading this fight against the climate crisis. It’s past time we take bold action to tackle climate change head on for future generations. #ClimateStrike #MAClimateStrike #BostonClimateStrike"
165,Elizabeth Warren,"The Trump administration failed the people of Puerto Rico, &amp; I’ve pushed @FEMA, @HUDgov, @DHSgov, @ENERGY, @OMBPress, @USDA, &amp; @FOMBPR for accountability. We will not forget the victims of #HurricaneMaria. Learn more about my work for Puerto Rico here:"
166,Elizabeth Warren,"And I have kept up oversight of @FEMA's Hurricane Maria contracting efforts, which have been part of the tragic mess that was the Administration's Puerto Rico disaster response. An investigation I requested revealed that FEMA did not follow federal procurements laws &amp; regs."
167,Elizabeth Warren,"Back in 2016, I opposed PROMESA, which imposed @FOMBPR on Puerto Rico. And since Hurricane Maria, I have repeatedly pushed that Board on its slashes to government services, its friendliness to Wall Street creditors, &amp; its conflicts of interest."
168,Elizabeth Warren,"In June, I cosponsored a bill to end the discriminatory double standards in the way Medicare &amp; Medicaid are administered in the US territories."
169,Elizabeth Warren,"With @SenatorMenendez &amp; Rep. @NydiaVelazquez, I questioned @FEMA about delays rebuilding the hospital on the island of Vieques, that served 9,000 US citizens &amp; was destroyed in Hurricane Maria. The next week, the agency confirmed it would be rebuilt."
170,Elizabeth Warren,I also reintroduced my bill with @RepEspaillat to make it easier for survivors of natural disasters like Hurricane Maria to receive housing assistance from @FEMA &amp; @HUDgov.
171,Elizabeth Warren,"In May, I reintroduced my bill, the US Territorial Relief Act, to give disaster-stricken US territories like Puerto Rico a path to comprehensive debt relief so they can recover &amp; rebuild with dignity."
172,Elizabeth Warren,"In February, I introduced my bill with Rep. @NydiaVelazquez to prevent @realDonaldTrump from using disaster relief funds to fund his border wall."
173,Elizabeth Warren,"After I investigated reports that the Administration was using the government shutdown as an excuse to stall aid to Puerto Rico, @HUDgov confirmed that the shutdown delayed billions of dollars of disaster relief funds for the island."
174,Elizabeth Warren,"In January, I reintroduced a bill with Sen. @GillibrandNY &amp; Rep. @NydiaVelazquez to establish a 9/11-style independent commission to investigate the federal response to the hurricanes in Puerto Rico."
175,Elizabeth Warren,"Two years ago today, Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands. I’m still persisting in this fight to ensure our government keeps its responsibility to help these US citizens recover &amp; thrive."
176,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m glad the Senate passed my bill with @SenTomCotton to ensure the POW/MIA flag is always displayed with the US flag in the Capitol, Vietnam Vets Memorial &amp; other federal properties. I’m working to get it passed in the House &amp; signed by the President."
177,Elizabeth Warren,"Thousands of American service members have been imprisoned &amp; are still missing in action from past conflicts. On #POWMIARecognitionDay we honor those who served and those who have not returned home. They must never be forgotten, &amp; I have a bill for that."
178,Elizabeth Warren,"On this second anniversary of #HurricaneMaria, I’m still fighting for our federal government to treat the US citizens on Puerto Rico with the respect they deserve."
179,Elizabeth Warren,"Incredible news: Our Senate office just received word that @USCIS will resume consideration of some deferred action requests, including medical deferred action for sick children. This is a powerful victory for people across the country who fought back &amp; made their voices heard."
180,Elizabeth Warren,"Dr. Emily Clyburn was a tireless voice for justice &amp; opportunity. My prayers are with @WhipClyburn, their family, &amp; the people of South Carolina for their loss."
181,Elizabeth Warren,"We should be investing in our Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities, not treating them &amp; their funding like political footballs. Senate Republicans need to stop the games &amp; pass critical funding for HBCUs this week."
182,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ve got a bill that would put private equity firms on the hook for the decisions made by the companies they control, including for-profit colleges. It’s long past time to hold these firms accountable for steering colleges into a ditch &amp; scamming students."
183,Elizabeth Warren,"In industry after industry, private equity firms have stripped companies of assets, loaded them with debt, extracted $$$ &amp; skipped away when the bets went bad. Students &amp; taxpayers deserve to understand the shadowy role these firms play in an industry already fraught with abuse."
184,Elizabeth Warren,"35% of for-profit students are enrolled in private equity-owned schools, &amp; those schools have higher tuition, more student borrowing, &amp; lower grad rates. Their business isn't educating students – it's sucking down federal student aid, which makes up nearly all of their revenue."
185,Elizabeth Warren,"Predatory for-profit colleges often load students with debt for useless degrees. They’re the worst, &amp; for-profit schools owned by private equity firms are the worst of the worst. So @RepMarkPocan &amp; I are investigating private equity takeovers of colleges."
186,Elizabeth Warren,"Senators’ thoughts &amp; prayers aren’t stopping the mass shootings, but our votes can. Time’s up, @SenateGOP. Stand up to the gun industry &amp; give these bills a vote."
187,Elizabeth Warren,"The majority of Americans support common sense gun safety laws &amp; are urging the Senate to take action. But @SenateMajLdr McConnell &amp; the @SenateGOP are too scared of the @NRA to act. Let's call this out for what it is: corruption, plain &amp; simple."
188,Elizabeth Warren,"Kids are being slaughtered in their classrooms. Mothers, fathers, brothers, &amp; sisters are being gunned down in places of worship, homes, clubs, supermarkets, &amp; streets. And day after day, tragedy after tragedy, we're still here begging the @SenateGOP to do something."
189,Elizabeth Warren,"The game is up: Amazon pretends to be a neutral marketplace platform, but it bulldozes competition by juicing the search results for its own products. Reports say even Amazon’s own lawyers identify this as an antitrust problem. The @FTC must take action."
190,Elizabeth Warren,"Hurricane Dorian devastated the Bahamas, but the Trump administration made the heartless decision not to grant Temporary Protected Status to impacted Bahamians. I joined @SenatorMenendez in introducing a bill to undo the administration’s immoral decision."
191,Elizabeth Warren,"Rev. Michael Haynes was a pillar of faith &amp; justice for the people of Boston. Bruce &amp; I send our prayers to his loved ones, Twelfth Baptist Church, &amp; the countless people touched by his kindness &amp; leadership in our community."
192,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m proud of our Boston &amp; Springfield students for standing up to the gun lobby to end gun violence. Our students are leading the fight to keep our schools &amp; streets safe, &amp; our government must follow their lead."
193,Elizabeth Warren,"Amazon has looked the other way while its contract delivery workers are forced into unsafe vehicles &amp; given dangerous workloads. @SenBlumenthal, @SenSherrodBrown, &amp; I want Amazon to explain this repeated disregard for workers’ rights &amp; safety."
194,Elizabeth Warren,Congress should pass @SenMarkey &amp; @RepLoriTrahan’s  Leonel Rondon Pipeline Safety Act to prevent disasters like the @ColumbiaGasMA explosions. And we should pass my Accountable Capitalism Act to force companies like @NiSource to pay attention to workers’ &amp; communities' interests.
195,Elizabeth Warren,"We’ve seen this pattern repeatedly: when corporate execs cut corners &amp; hurt consumers, they leave taxpayers &amp; communities to clean up the mess. Merrimack Valley small businesses are still digging out of a financial hole from repairs &amp; lost customers."
196,Elizabeth Warren,"The @NTSB blamed the Merrimack Valley gas explosions squarely on @ColumbiaGasMA  &amp; @NiSourceInc. But when we asked their executives about ""personal responsibility"" at @SenMarkey’s hearing, we heard nobody got fired. A young man died, so they probably wouldn’t get an annual bonus."
197,Elizabeth Warren,"One year ago, the @ColumbiaGasMA explosions destroyed Merrimack Valley homes &amp; businesses &amp; tragically killed a young man. Mayor @danrivera01843 &amp; I wrote to the @EagleTrib about what must be done to prevent a disaster like this from ever happening again."
198,Elizabeth Warren,"Students who get scammed by a predatory for-profit college should not by punished by losing their Pell Grant eligibility. I’m glad to reintroduce the Pell Grant Restoration Act with our House cosponsors @RepJahanaHayes, @RepMGS, &amp; @RepLucyMcBath."
199,Elizabeth Warren,"Many 9/11 first responders still experience illnesses &amp; other injuries from Ground Zero. This anniversary, I'm grateful for @gillibrandny's longtime leadership to extend compensation for 9/11 first responders."
200,Elizabeth Warren,"18 years ago, nearly 3,000 Americans – including 206 people from MA – died when terrorists attacked our shores. This 9/11 anniversary, let's come together to remember the lives lost, and take care our first responders and their loved ones. #NeverForget"
201,Elizabeth Warren,The @USArmy IG’s review of the military housing program revealed many of the same systemic problems as my investigation. We need to act quickly to pass my bill with @RepDebHaaland to improve housing conditions for military families.
202,Elizabeth Warren,"When I learned that many military families face poor on-base housing conditions because of greedy, big housing companies &amp; the Pentagon's failed oversight of this program, I investigated, &amp; then I introduced a bill to make it right."
203,Elizabeth Warren,John Bolton has never met a war he didn’t like. He never should have been National Security Adviser in the first place.
204,Elizabeth Warren,"At least 3 migrant children in US custody died, in part, from the flu – but @CBP won’t administer flu vaccines to detained families. @SecAzar &amp; @DHSMcAleenan should reverse this immoral &amp; irresponsible decision."
205,Elizabeth Warren,"In the middle of a housing affordability crisis, the Trump Administration wants to make it harder for creditworthy working families – especially families of color – to buy a home &amp; build wealth. That’s shameful."
206,Elizabeth Warren,My Anti-Corruption &amp; Public Integrity Act includes &amp; builds on the Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act to fundamentally change the way Washington does business. Congress should pass it &amp; help restore the American people’s faith in democracy.
207,Elizabeth Warren,"Weeks before @realDonaldTrump was sworn into office, I introduced the Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act to require the President &amp; VP to fully divest from any potential financial conflicts of interest – including Trump hotels in Ireland, DC, &amp; everywhere else."
208,Elizabeth Warren,.@VP Pence’s taxpayer-funded stay at @realDonaldTrump’s Ireland golf resort is just another example of this admin’s open corruption &amp; how it enriches the President. I want the @StateDept to explain who planned this trip &amp; its cost to the American people.
209,Elizabeth Warren,"The Trump administration has created a humanitarian catastrophe at the border with cruel policies that deliberately inflict pain on children &amp; families. We must shut down for-profit detention facilities, stop family separation, &amp; create a fair, humane immigration system."
210,Elizabeth Warren,"The @OIGatHHS report is appalling: long detention resulted in “defiance, hopelessness, &amp; frustration among children, along with more instances of self-harm &amp; suicidal ideation.” “Acute grief that caused them to cry inconsolably.” “Every single separated kid has been terrified.”"
211,Elizabeth Warren,"This administration is not adequately caring for the health of detained migrant children who may have been abused, kidnapped, tortured, or witnesses to murder – &amp; its family separation policies are only hurting these children more. https://t.co/bWB7rEavrE"
212,Elizabeth Warren,"Most child detention facilities let employees start working without a background check, &amp; some received background check waivers entirely. Simply put, these facilities are understaffed. And staff are often unqualified to care for traumatized children. https://t.co/CLg5yT118h"
213,Elizabeth Warren,"In June, @SenBrianSchatz &amp; I led a request that @OIGatHHS investigate the troubling allegations about the health &amp; safety of migrant children at federal contractor facilities. Two of their reports confirm some of these concerns."
214,Elizabeth Warren,"Five people in MA this year have contracted Eastern equine encephalitis, a rare but potentially fatal virus with no treatment. @SenMarkey &amp; I have asked @NIAIDNews for info about federal research into EEE so we can prevent &amp; treat this dangerous illness."
215,Elizabeth Warren,"Toys “R” Us. Sears. Radio Shack. Payless. Shopko. Private equity firms are killing jobs, hurting workers, &amp; draining our economy. I’ve got a bill to #StopWallStreetLooting – &amp; I’m in this fight with @forrespect all the way."
216,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ve spent years in the Senate fighting back against predatory for-profit colleges &amp; the companies, banks, organizations &amp; officials that enable them to scam students. I won’t stop fighting @usedgov until students receive the debt relief they deserve."
217,Elizabeth Warren,"When shady for-profit colleges cheat students, those students are entitled to get their student loans cancelled. That’s the law. I’m disgusted that @BetsyDeVosED is making it harder for defrauded students to have their loans discharged."
218,Elizabeth Warren,I’m concerned about reports of two separate incidents of racist &amp; anti-Semitic graffiti at Fort Revere Park &amp; Watuppa Reservation in MA over the past week. Cowardly acts of hate don’t belong in the Commonwealth or anywhere else in this country.
219,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m glad that the Trump administration is having second thoughts about deporting sick children after we fought back, but this partial reversal just isn't good enough. @USCIS must fully reverse its cruel policy to reject medical deferred action requests."
220,Elizabeth Warren,".@WhipClyburn &amp; I are sorry that we won’t see everyone at @SCState1896 tomorrow, but your safety is our biggest concern. South Carolina, please take care &amp; follow @SCEMD for the latest information about Hurricane #Dorian."
221,Elizabeth Warren,"Happy #LaborDay! Today we say loud &amp; clear: unions built America’s middle class, &amp; unions will rebuild America’s middle class."
222,Elizabeth Warren,"Coming out of the Great Depression, labor unions helped build America’s strong middle class. As our families got richer, our country got richer – &amp; labor unions were a big part of it. Today, unions are under attack, &amp; we need to fight back so workers can make their voices heard."
223,Elizabeth Warren,"Time’s up, @SenateMajLdr. Let’s vote on gun safety legislation NOW. Every day you wait, more tragedies happen. Do something, Senator McConnell. America is done waiting for you."
224,Elizabeth Warren,My Payment Modernization Act would create a national payments system so the money deposited in your bank account appears in real-time. No more living in fear over Labor Day that your rent will be processed before your paycheck clears. Congress should act to make this happen.
225,Elizabeth Warren,This is the sort of weekend that terrifies people living paycheck-to-paycheck:🏠 Rent is due Sunday 9/1💰 Friday’s deposited paycheck may not clear for days because of the holiday weekendOverdraft fees &amp; payday lenders shouldn't be the solution. I’ve got a bill for that.
226,Elizabeth Warren,I’m in this fight for America’s workers every step of the way. #LaborDay
227,Elizabeth Warren,"We must take emissions seriously &amp; hold polluters accountable to avoid environmental catastrophe. In July, @FSCDems passed my Climate Risk Disclosure Act to make companies disclose climate-related risks. @SenateMajLdr McConnell, give our bill a vote."
228,Elizabeth Warren,"The Trump administration’s proposal to roll back methane emissions rules is a giant wet kiss to Big Oil &amp; other dirty polluters. The #climatecrisis threatens our health, economy, &amp; national security – &amp; this reckless plan will only make it worse."
229,Elizabeth Warren,People come to MA from around the world to receive life-saving care. Now the Trump admin could be handing sick kids a death sentence along with deportation papers. @USCIS must reverse its heartless policy of rejecting all medical deferred action requests.
230,Elizabeth Warren,The federal government failed our fellow US citizens in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. We cannot fail them again. #Dorian
231,Elizabeth Warren,"If @USCIS truly wants to address the urgent needs of migrants at the border, it can start by reversing its unconscionable expansion of detention camps &amp; other bad policies. Suspending asylum interviews is another cruel way to hurt families fleeing violence, persecution &amp; poverty."
232,Elizabeth Warren,"There are 40,000 pending asylum cases in New England that will essentially be frozen by @USCIS’ decision to suspend asylum interviews in Boston. This is an unfair &amp; unjustified shift of resources that will force applicants who have been waiting for years to wait even longer."
233,Elizabeth Warren,".@USCIS’ decision to gut their New England asylum office won’t help the humanitarian crisis at the border – it will inflame it. @SenMarkey, @RepPressley &amp; I want @USCISCuccinelli to explain why his agency is further straining our asylum backlog."
234,Elizabeth Warren,"This pick for @CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman is a slap in the face to student loan borrowers in MA &amp; across the country. They deserve better. That’s why @CFPBDirector &amp; @stevenmnuchin1 should pick someone else with real experience fighting for students, not another industry hack."
235,Elizabeth Warren,"The @CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman is supposed to protect students, but the Admin's pick was a top lawyer for @MyFedLoan – a student loan giant being sued by @MassAGO for undermining Public Service Loan Forgiveness &amp; overcharging student borrowers."
236,Elizabeth Warren,Need proof that the Trump administration works for student loan companies &amp; not student loan borrowers? They just appointed a former executive from a giant student loan company to be the nation’s top student loan watchdog at the @CFPB. It’s outrageous.
237,Elizabeth Warren,"When retail stores or mining companies go bankrupt, their owners should have to prioritize workers' pay so they receive the severance, pensions, &amp; other payments they earned. That’s exactly what my bill to #StopWallStreetLooting would do."
238,Elizabeth Warren,.@realdonaldtrump's latest attack on immigrant families is to keep kids and their parents in cages indefinitely. Families fleeing violence and persecution don't belong in filthy prisons. I'll fight this policy and all attacks on immigrant communities.
239,Elizabeth Warren,"The United States already has nearly 4,000 nuclear weapons in our active arsenal, &amp; our conventional military might is overwhelming. Doubling down on more nuclear weapons while scrapping nuclear treaties undercuts our nonproliferation efforts around the world."
240,Elizabeth Warren,"We urge keeping provisions that:☢️Ban the deployment of dangerous, costly &amp; unnecessary W76-2 low-yield nuclear warheads☢️Call on the Trump admin to extend the New START treaty☢️Deny funding for certain nuclear missiles to prevent an arms race following the INF Treaty collapse"
241,Elizabeth Warren,A nuclear arms race doesn’t make the U.S. – or the world – any safer. That’s why I’m leading 17 other senators in urging @JimInhofe &amp; @SenJackReed to include 3 key nuclear weapons provisions in next year’s defense budget.
242,Elizabeth Warren,I’m done hearing about all the new ways @WellsFargo is cheating its customers. And I’m done with President Trump’s appointed regulators who look the other way. Wells Fargo is fundamentally broken. I’m going to keep fighting with everything I’ve got to hold them accountable.
243,Elizabeth Warren,Here’s the deal: In the past 3 years @WellsFargo has sworn up &amp; down that it’s changed – &amp; it’s been caught scamming customers &amp; lying to regulators in more than a dozen ways. Fake accounts. Unneeded auto insurance fees. Wrongful foreclosures &amp; repossessed cars. Enough is enough.
244,Elizabeth Warren,"Three years after the fake accounts scandal, @WellsFargo got caught raking in cash from accounts that its customers didn’t know they had – AGAIN. Today I’m opening an investigation &amp; demanding answers."
245,Elizabeth Warren,"In 2013, I asked why a kid caught with an ounce of drugs goes to jail, but a bank exec that launders a billion dollars in drug money pays a fine &amp; sleeps in their own bed at night. It's clear: we have one justice system for the rich &amp; powerful, &amp; another for everybody else."
246,Elizabeth Warren,"We need stronger rules on Wall Street, &amp; tough regulators to enforce them. That’s why my anti-corruption bill locks the revolving door between Wall Street &amp; Washington, &amp; my Ending Too Big to Jail Act puts big bank executives in handcuffs when their banks break the law."
247,Elizabeth Warren,The American people have a right to know how &amp; why @realDonaldTrump’s political appointees at @TheJusticeDept are influencing the settlement process to help @Barclays &amp; @RBS avoid accountability for their role in the 2008 financial crisis. I want answers.
248,Elizabeth Warren,"After the 2008 financial crisis, millions lost their homes, jobs, &amp; life savings – &amp; no CEOs went to jail. A decade later, it’s unconscionable that @TheJusticeDept still won't hold corporate criminals accountable for their role in breaking our economy."
249,Elizabeth Warren,"The Trump administration is deliberately obstructing low-income people’s access to basic health care services &amp; interfering in medical decisions made by patients &amp; their doctors. If the administration won’t #ProtectX, then the courts must."
250,Elizabeth Warren,"Make no mistake: this is a direct attack on the Fair Housing Act at a time when housing costs are skyrocketing &amp; too many families, especially families of color, face vicious discrimination. @HUDgov should be strengthening anti-discrimination rules, not weakening them."
251,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, @HUDgov is proposing a rule that would give landlords, mortgage lenders, &amp; others the power to discriminate against homebuyers &amp; renters with no consequences."
252,Elizabeth Warren,What did the tortoise do when the Student Loan Debt Relief Act became law? Shell-ebrated being turtle-y debt free!
253,Elizabeth Warren,".@RepDebHaaland &amp; I invite feedback about this proposal &amp; look forward to working closely with tribal nations &amp; citizens, experts, &amp; other stakeholders to advance legislation in Congress that honors the United States’ promises to Native peoples."
254,Elizabeth Warren,"Last year, @USCCRgov released its “Broken Promises” report on the govt's failures to Native communities. Our Honoring Promises to Native Nations Act will address that report’s concerns on criminal justice &amp; public safety, health care, education, economic development, &amp; housing."
255,Elizabeth Warren,The US government has a responsibility to honor its obligations to Native peoples. That’s why I’m working with @RepDebHaaland to draft a bill to empower tribal nations &amp; address the chronic underfunding in Indian Country. Learn more about our proposal:
256,Elizabeth Warren,"@realDonaldTrump While we fight to #ProtectTheDream &amp; fix our country’s broken immigration system, it’s powerfully important for all DACA recipients to keep their status up-to-date. Renew your DACA status here:"
257,Elizabeth Warren,"Happy 84th birthday, Social Security! For 22 million seniors, veterans, children, and people with disabilities, Social Security is all that stands between them &amp; poverty. I’m proud to lead the fight to protect &amp; expand Social Security in the Senate."
258,Elizabeth Warren,"The Vineyard Wind project will create thousands of jobs &amp; generate cleaner, cheaper wind energy for MA families. The Trump admin should work towards a solution that will protect the environment, address local fishermen's concerns &amp; allow the project to move forward without delay."
259,Elizabeth Warren,The Trump administration’s last-minute decision to delay approval of the Vineyard Wind clean energy project is extremely disappointing. Once again they’ve chosen to put corporate polluters’ profits over Americans’ well-being.
260,Elizabeth Warren,The @FTC is supposed to protect Americans from deceptive advertising. Instead they misinformed consumers about the terms of the @Equifax settlement. The FTC should explain how this happened.
261,Elizabeth Warren,"145 million Americans qualified for the $125 @Equifax settlement refund that the @FTC advertised. But let’s do the math: A $31,000,000 compensation fund ÷ $125 = 248,000 checks.   That's right: the FTC planned for less than 1% of people to get the money they’re owed."
262,Elizabeth Warren,We all saw the tweets: sign up to get $125 back from @Equifax for exposing your personal data. Here’s the problem: the @FTC didn’t plan on you doing it. I want the FTC Inspector General to investigate how the agency misled the American people.
263,Elizabeth Warren,"We need bold action to build more affordable housing and help families live strong, healthy lives – and I’ve got a bill for that."
264,Elizabeth Warren,Every kid deserves a chance to succeed – no matter where they’re from. I’m fighting back against @DHSgov’s harmful new policy &amp; fighting to protect immigrant families in MA and across the country.
265,Elizabeth Warren,"President Trump’s agenda is clear: blame our country’s problems on people who don’t look like you, or speak like you, or pray like you – and when we turn on each other, we can’t unite to fight back against a rigged system."
266,Elizabeth Warren,"The Trump administration just put out a new rule to punish immigrant families – discouraging them from getting food, health care, or housing assistance for themselves or their children, &amp; making it harder for them to become U.S. citizens."
267,Elizabeth Warren,We need to stop self-dealing public officials &amp; padlock the revolving door between big business &amp; government. That’s why I’ve introduced the most ambitious anti-corruption legislation since Watergate. These reforms will help us build a country &amp; a government worth fighting for.
268,Elizabeth Warren,"Our national crisis of faith in government boils down to this simple fact: people don’t trust their government to do the right thing because they think it works for the rich &amp; powerful, not for the American people. And here’s the kicker: They’re right."
269,Elizabeth Warren,".@Novartis manipulated testing data to rush its drug to market &amp; exploit govt perks. Now its $2.1M spinal muscular atrophy drug is the most expensive med in US history. The @US_FDA works for the people, not big pharma, &amp; must hold Novartis accountable."
270,Elizabeth Warren,Great to see schools like @UMassAmherst taking real steps to address student hunger on campus! Congress can help more colleges tackle this problem by expanding access to SNAP for more low-income students. @RepAlLawsonJr &amp; I have a bill for that.
271,Elizabeth Warren,"Surprise surprise: the @USChamber's Big Oil &amp; Coal lawyers are fighting the @LungAssociation’s lawsuit against the Trump admin’s attack on clean air &amp; our climate. The Chamber should be fighting for green jobs, not bullying public health advocates."
272,Elizabeth Warren,It took @CapitalOne nearly 4 months to detect the data breach &amp; they’re still working to notify customers. People deserve timely info about what exactly Capital One is doing to protect people’s personal data at risk because of the company's security failures.
273,Elizabeth Warren,"According to news reports, the @CapitalOne hacker had worked for Amazon Web Services, which hosts the company’s database. I’m troubled that other employees may have the same knowledge the hacker had, &amp; the security weaknesses allegedly exploited are “commonly known.”"
274,Elizabeth Warren,"Last week, @CapitalOne reported a massive data breach that compromised personal data of more than 100 million customers &amp; credit card applicants. I want to know how this happened, how they're fixing this vulnerability, &amp; who is being held accountable."
275,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m glad the @DHSOIG is investigating @CBP’s alarming surveillance reportedly targeting journalists, attorneys, &amp; organizers. The American people deserve answers about how &amp; why @DHSgov obtained this info &amp; how they’ve used"
276,Elizabeth Warren,"Our military leaders understand that America’s foreign policy cannot be run exclusively by the Pentagon. We should be investing in diplomacy &amp; development to address political, social &amp; economic problems before they morph into costly wars."
277,Elizabeth Warren,"America’s defense budget is more bloated than ever, but our national security cannot rely on a strong military alone. So why in the world is @realDonaldTrump trying to block billions in the @StateDept’s diplomacy, development &amp; global health funds?"
278,Elizabeth Warren,I’m glad the @FederalReserve has finally taken action so working families &amp; small business owners don’t have to wait up to 5 days to get paid &amp; pay their bills. I look forward to working with the Fed to ensure this system is implemented swiftly &amp; smoothly.
279,Elizabeth Warren,"Just like the hateful terrorism of Al Qaeda &amp; ISIS, domestic right-wing terrorism &amp; white nationalism is completely incompatible with our American values. It is a threat to American safety &amp; security, &amp; we must not tolerate it in the United States."
280,Elizabeth Warren,The House passed a bill more than 5 months ago to require basic background checks on gun sales — the very least we can do to keep our loved ones safe. How many more people need to die before @SenateMajLdr McConnell puts aside @NRA interests and gives that bill a vote?
281,Elizabeth Warren,"Tonight I’m heartsick for El Paso &amp; I’m once again disgusted by the GOP leadership in Washington. Americans shouldn’t have to live in fear that if they go to Walmart, or a festival, or school, or just walk down the street that they won’t make it home alive. This has to stop."
282,Elizabeth Warren,Withdrawing from the INF Treaty won't make us or our European allies safer. We should be holding Russia accountable for its violations – not torching the treaty that has prevented a dangerous arms race for over 30 years.
283,Elizabeth Warren,".@RepPressley &amp; @RepLoriTrahan are both smart, passionate, &amp; fearless leaders for the people of Massachusetts &amp; people all across our country. I’m lucky to have them fighting by my side in Washington."
284,Elizabeth Warren,"Contrary to popular belief, I too am not @SenatorBaldwin or @SenTinaSmith – but I couldn’t have said this better myself. Climate change is an existential threat to the Great Lakes, New England, and every corner of this country. It’s time for Washington to fight back."
285,Elizabeth Warren,The first step to fix the student debt crisis is to deal with the outstanding debt that never should have been required in the first place. That’s why I’ve got a bill with @WhipClyburn to cancel student debt for 42 million Americans. #CancelMyDebt
286,Elizabeth Warren,"America’s students did everything we told them to do: they worked hard, got good grades, &amp; went to college – &amp; now they’re drowning in debt. Washington is to blame for putting the interests of billionaires &amp; giant corporations over middle class families."
287,Elizabeth Warren,"My friend @AdyBarkan came to the Senate a few months ago to testify about why we need #MedicareForAll. Health care is a basic human right, and it’s people like Ady – &amp; the people I hear from across MA &amp; around the country – who keep me in this fight."
288,Elizabeth Warren,"I asked @DHSOIG to find out how many US citizens have been detained by @CBP &amp; @ICEgov, why, for how long, &amp; under what conditions. They need to examine what procedures are in place to stop these wrongful arrests &amp; mistaken detentions, &amp; whether agents are using racial profiling."
289,Elizabeth Warren,9-year-old Julia Isabel Amparo Medina was detained on her way to school at a border stop when @CBP officers claimed she didn’t look like her photo on her passport card. This little girl – an American citizen – was wrongly held for 32 hours.
290,Elizabeth Warren,"Francisco Erwin Galicia is a US citizen who was detained at the border after @CBP claimed his TX birth certificate, ID, &amp; Social Security card were fake. He was held for more than 3 weeks &amp; lost 26 pounds from lack of food."
291,Elizabeth Warren,"This is a nightmare: US citizens were stopped by @CBP, presented their proof of citizenship, &amp; were held without recourse for hours, days, or weeks. I want @DHSOIG to investigate this potentially severe &amp; unacceptable abuse of power."
292,Elizabeth Warren,"Investing in clean energy &amp; green manufacturing can grow our economy &amp; reverse factory job losses from the past 2 decades, while making sure we #ActOnClimate. It’s beyond time for the @USChamber &amp; @ShopFloorNAM to get on board. #ChamberofCarbon"
293,Elizabeth Warren,"American businesses should be leading the fight against the #ClimateCrisis &amp; dominating the clean energy economy. But the @USChamber, @ShopFloorNAM, &amp; their armies of lobbyists have spent decades dragging their feet &amp; rigging the rules for giant oil companies. #ChamberofCarbon"
294,Elizabeth Warren,"Threatening to use nuclear weapons first makes America less safe because it increases the chances of a miscalculation or an accident. There are no winners in a nuclear war, and the US should never start one. I have a bill for that. https://t.co/8NwS5g65YT"
295,Elizabeth Warren,White House acting Chief of Staff @MickMulvaneyOMB – who hired Blankenstein at the @CFPB – celebrated his employee’s racist writings. @SenSherrodBrown &amp; I are concerned that Mulvaney influenced @HUDgov’s decision to hire Blankenstein.
296,Elizabeth Warren,"Based on this new report, the @OIGFedCFPB should investigate the @CFPB’s decision to dismantle the agency's Office of Fair Lending &amp; Equal Opportunity. With Blankenstein in charge, there are too many unanswered questions about their actions &amp; motivations."
297,Elizabeth Warren,Former @CFPB policy director Eric Blankenstein got a big job at @HUDgov even after his racist writings became public. Now a damning @OIGFedCFPB report shows he “may have abused his authority” at the CFPB. Enough is enough. Blankenstein must go.
298,Elizabeth Warren,"Congrats to bus drivers on Martha’s Vineyard for reaching their first-ever contract agreement with @VTA_MV &amp; @ATUComm! When workers fight, we win."
299,Elizabeth Warren,Yes – and I’ve got a bill for that. #StopWallStreetLooting
300,Elizabeth Warren,"The avg cost of child care in MA is over $20K/yr – more than in-state tuition at UMass. When families can’t afford high-quality care, their kids are at a disadvantage before they even reach kindergarten. That’s why I've got a bill for #UniversalChildCare."
301,Elizabeth Warren,There’s no better place to spend a beautiful summer weekend than Cape Cod. Please come show your support for our local MA businesses!
302,Elizabeth Warren,The Puerto Rican island of Vieques was heavily polluted by decades of US military bombing exercises. That's why @RepAOC &amp; I have led our colleagues in urging funding for safer cleanup there. We owe it to our fellow citizens in Vieques &amp; across Puerto Rico.
303,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m proud of the way our first responders, local officials, &amp; communities have come together on the Cape this week. Massachusetts knows that when we help our neighbors, we make each other stronger."
304,Elizabeth Warren,Forcing migrants into “voluntary” work programs for $1/hr by threatening to withhold basic necessities or throw them in solitary confinement is inhumane &amp; raises serious legal questions. I wrote to @DHSOIG to investigate this unacceptable practice.
305,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenateMajLdr McConnell has the power RIGHT NOW to make our elections safer. Just today he blocked a vote on the SAFE Act, a bill the House passed to protect &amp; improve voting systems. Enough is enough, @SenateGOP. Read the report &amp; protect our democracy. Do your job."
306,Elizabeth Warren,"In 2016, the Russian govt tried to infiltrate our state elections systems – &amp; yesterday Robert Mueller testified that they’re still “doing it as we sit here.” This is a national security threat. Everyone should read this new Senate Intel Committee report. https://t.co/jFeb4t7fhr"
307,Elizabeth Warren,Let's get real: Zinke is making big bucks to help oil companies influence the govt. That’s lobbying. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would fix the Swiss cheese definition of lobbyist &amp; put a lifetime lobbying ban on cabinet members so guys like Zinke can’t exploit our land OR govt.
308,Elizabeth Warren,"Ryan Zinke resigned after using the @Interior Dept like his own personal piggy bank. So he found a better way to cash in: working for the oil &amp; mining companies he used to regulate. I guess when you’re caught in a hole of corruption, just keep"
309,Elizabeth Warren,The @AmerMedicalAssn says gun violence is a public health crisis – but the @NRA has spent decades blocking funding for scientific research to prevent it. This shouldn’t be a partisan issue – the Senate should #FundGVPResearch because #ResearchSavesLives.
310,Elizabeth Warren,"Woo-hoo! The House unanimously passed the PRIDE Act, which included my bill with @RepJudyChu &amp; @RepAndyLevin to let legally married same-sex couples get the tax refunds they were denied. @senatemajldr should do what's right &amp; give our bill a vote."
311,Elizabeth Warren,"These cowardly acts of racism, anti-Semitism, bigotry &amp; hate have no place in Massachusetts or anywhere else in this country."
312,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump vetoed 3 resolutions that would prevent him from selling arms to Saudi Arabia &amp; the UAE without Congressional approval. We must put the interests of the Yemeni people above US defense contractors &amp; end our role in this war.
313,Elizabeth Warren,Our payments bill will make sure that families have faster access to the money they earned &amp; save people billions of dollars each year from paying overdraft fees or turning to shady payday lenders to make ends meet.
314,Elizabeth Warren,"My Payment Modernization Act with @ChrisVanHollen, @RepPressley &amp; @RepChuyGarcia would require the @FederalReserve to create a national payments system so checks deposited in your bank account appear in real time. No more anxiously waiting over a weekend or holiday."
315,Elizabeth Warren,People living paycheck-to-paycheck can’t wait days for a check to clear to pay for rent or groceries. And they shouldn't have to – central banks in other countries already have real-time payments systems. So we’ve got a bill for that.
316,Elizabeth Warren,Private equity firms have gutted some of America’s biggest retail chains &amp; walked away scot-free while workers lost everything. That’s why my bill to #StopWallStreetLooting would protect workers &amp; fundamentally change the private equity industry.
317,Elizabeth Warren,We already knew that the @FTC’s $5 billion settlement with @facebook is a drop-in-the-bucket penalty. The fine print proves that it’s a joke.
318,Elizabeth Warren,"Watch the second part of Robert Mueller’s House hearing here. Mueller’s testimony has already made it clear that the President obstructed justice, that Mueller’s investigation did not exonerate him, and that Congress must act."
319,Elizabeth Warren,Watch Robert Mueller’s testimony here. It should be clear to anyone who read the Mueller Report that Congress has a constitutional duty to begin impeachment proceedings. I hope Congress is paying attention today.
320,Elizabeth Warren,America’s trade deals have delivered one gut punch after another to America’s workers &amp; the unions that fight for them. The last thing workers need is a NAFTA 2.0 deal rigged by Big Pharma to keep prescription drug prices high.
321,Elizabeth Warren,"My office is monitoring the severe weather on the Cape &amp; the power outage impacting up to 30,000 homes. Please follow @MassEMA for directions &amp; information to keep your family safe."
322,Elizabeth Warren,"Today @WhipClyburn &amp; I are officially introducing our Student Loan Debt Relief Act to cancel student debt for millions of Americans, end the student debt crisis, &amp; help tackle the racial wealth gap. Tune in live to our announcement. #CancelMyDebt"
323,Elizabeth Warren,Private equity investor Leo Hindery is right – too often his industry incentivizes “reckless &amp; often immoral behavior” &amp; it desperately needs reform. I’m glad to have his support to #StopWallStreetLooting so American workers &amp; companies can succeed.
324,Elizabeth Warren,"Thank you, @RepDebHaaland, for defending our shared values that there is space for everyone in this country, and that nobody in our community should be left behind. I’m grateful for your important perspective and your leadership against hatred and racism."
325,Elizabeth Warren,But I learned something in that fight for Dodd-Frank nine years ago today: You don’t get what you don’t fight for. I’m honored to have the opportunity to use every tool in the toolbox to hold Wall Street accountable &amp; make our government work for the people.
326,Elizabeth Warren,I'll just be blunt: The @realDonaldTrump administration is fighting to kill the rules on Wall Street &amp; gut the @CFPB at any chance they can. The cops on the beat are only looking out for the crooks who are cheating American consumers.
327,Elizabeth Warren,"And my new #StopWallStreetLooting Act that I introduced this past week would fundamentally change the private equity industry to prevent Wall Street from destroying companies like Toys “R” Us, Sears, &amp; Shopko."
328,Elizabeth Warren,My bill to #EndCorruptionNow – the most ambitious anti-corruption legislation since Watergate –  would help lock the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington to make our government work for the people.
329,Elizabeth Warren,"After @Equifax compromised the personal data of at least 145 million Americans, I fought to hold them accountable &amp; introduced the Data Breach Prevention and Compensation Act to impose massive, mandatory fines when credit reporting agencies expose people’s personal data."
330,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ve introduced the Ending Too Big to Jail Act to hold Wall Street executives criminally accountable for their banks’ fraud &amp; illegal activity. When Wall Street CEOs break the law, they should go to jail like anyone else."
331,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m the author &amp; lead sponsor of the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, legislation to separate boring commercial banking (checking &amp; savings accounts) from risky investment banking, to make our financial system safer &amp; prevent another Wall St bailout."
332,Elizabeth Warren,And when @WellsFargo then named Tim Sloan CEO – a 30-year Wells Fargo executive who got rich off the fake accounts scandal &amp; helped cover it up – I called for his removal too. (He was.)
333,Elizabeth Warren,"In 2016, I called on @WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf to resign after his bank opened millions of fake accounts in their customers’ names. (He did.)"
334,Elizabeth Warren,"In 2013, I asked why a kid caught with an ounce of drugs will go to jail, but a bank exec that launders a billion dollars in drug money pays a fine and gets to go home to sleep in their own bed at night."
335,Elizabeth Warren,"The big banks have fought financial reform – especially the @CFPB – every step of the way. So from my first Senate banking committee hearing in 2013, I’ve pushed our banking regulators to hold Wall St accountable for cheating people &amp; breaking our economy."
336,Elizabeth Warren,"Exactly 8 years ago, we opened the doors at the @CFPB. Eight years since we built an agency to get the tricks &amp; traps out of the fine print of credit cards, mortgages, &amp; other financial products. And in 8 years, it’s returned billions of dollars to people who have been cheated."
337,Elizabeth Warren,"Nine years ago today, I ran out of the Senate – where I was a witness testifying about the TARP Wall St bailout – and raced to the @WhiteHouse. With seconds to spare, I got to see President @BarackObama sign Dodd-Frank, the Wall Street reform bill that gave us the @CFPB."
338,Elizabeth Warren,"Workers from Sears, Toys “R” Us, &amp; Shopko have had to fight tooth &amp; nail for their pay, severance, &amp; pensions. I was proud to be joined by those workers this week to introduce the #StopWallStreetLooting Act to hold private equity firms accountable for the companies they buy."
339,Elizabeth Warren,"Retail stores aren’t the only ones gutted by private equity. Local papers have been hit hard by investment funds that load them with debt, cut staff, &amp; squeeze them until they go under. My #StopWallStreetLooting Act gives newspapers a fighting chance."
340,Elizabeth Warren,"Earlier this week @realDonaldTrump’s administration issued a sweeping asylum ban. Now they’re trying to end refugee admissions. The President wants to slam the door on people fleeing persecution &amp; put them back in danger. This is cruel, unnecessary, &amp; un-American."
341,Elizabeth Warren,I’m very glad that @TheNationsFirst &amp; our state leaders will continue to allow transgender Americans to serve in the MA National Guard. Our Commonwealth is safer when we allow everyone who can handle the job to serve.
342,Elizabeth Warren,"We must end the worst abuses of private equity that kill jobs, hurt workers, &amp; drain our economy. The #StopWallStreetLooting Act is a bold new plan to fundamentally change the industry."
343,Elizabeth Warren,Our new #StopWallStreetLooting Act would:✔️Put private investment funds on the hook for their companies' debt &amp; liabilities✔️End corporate looting through excessive fees &amp; dividends✔️Protects workers' jobs &amp; severance✔️Safeguard the markets from risky corporate debt
344,Elizabeth Warren,"When companies like Sears fail, workers lose everything. But the private equity &amp; investment funds? They collect huge fees &amp; move on to the next big deal. It’s time to #StopWallStreetLooting to protect workers &amp; hold private equity accountable."
345,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s not just stores at the mall that suffer from Wall Street looting. Private equity has ruined newspapers, manufactured housing, grocery stores, &amp; even nursing homes in MA &amp; across the country."
346,Elizabeth Warren,"@SenatorBaldwin @SenSherrodBrown @repmarkpocan @RepJayapal When I was a kid, my mom’s job at Sears saved our family. But that Sears doesn’t exist today. Neither does Payless, Shopko, or Gymboree. That’s because private equity &amp; investment funds bought them, stripped them for parts, &amp; drove them into the ground. #StopWallStreetLooting"
347,Elizabeth Warren,"Private equity firms want you to believe you’re not smart enough to understand their business model. But it's pretty simple: take over companies &amp; loot 'em. And I’ve got a bill with @SenatorBaldwin, @SenSherrodBrown, @RepMarkPocan &amp; @RepJayapal to fix it. #StopWallStreetLooting"
348,Elizabeth Warren,"Food insecurity is a real, structural problem that’s another barrier between low-income students &amp; the chance to finally get a college education. The College Student Hunger Act will tackle this problem head-on. We can fix this. #RealCollege"
349,Elizabeth Warren,My College Student Hunger Act with @RepAlLawsonJr would:❌ Expand access to SNAP for more low-income students❌ Increase outreach to eligible students❌ Require @usedgov &amp; @USDA to connect eligible students with SNAP
350,Elizabeth Warren,"As more &amp; more students struggle to pay for college, 30% may be going hungry. Students shouldn’t have to choose between paying tuition &amp; eating. That’s why I’ve got a bill to ensure college students can succeed without going hungry. #RealCollege"
351,Elizabeth Warren,"I have a bill for that. Congress should pass my #CAREAct with @RepCummings to provide cities, counties, states, territories, &amp; tribal governments with the comprehensive funding they need to fight the opioid epidemic. We can do this right now."
352,Elizabeth Warren,Great news: @FSCDems passed my Climate Risk Disclosure Act with @RepCasten yesterday. We’re one step closer to requiring public companies to disclose their climate-related risks and speeding up the transition to a green economy.
353,Elizabeth Warren,"Let’s be very clear: @realDonaldTrump’s tweets were racist. Persist, @SpeakerPelosi. Persist. #shepersisted"
354,Elizabeth Warren,"The American people deserve to know that the @DeptofDefense Secretary will make decisions in our country’s best security interests, not in @Raytheon’s or his own financial interests. If @EsperDoD won’t commit to address his conflicts, he should not be confirmed."
355,Elizabeth Warren,"Last week, I met with @EsperDoD &amp; asked him to extend his @Raytheon recusal through the duration of his tenure at the @DeptofDefense. He refused. I’m troubled by Esper’s unwillingness to fully address his conflicts of interest &amp; urge him to reconsider."
356,Elizabeth Warren,"Mark @EsperDoD ran @Raytheon’s lobbying shop for 7 years. In fact, he’s still waiting on a million-dollar payout from them after 2022. I have serious ethical concerns about his @DeptofDefense Secretary nomination."
357,Elizabeth Warren,"My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would shut the revolving door between the government &amp; big business, including @CommerceGov &amp; the steel industry. It’s long past time to root out corruption in every corner of our government &amp; make it work for the people."
358,Elizabeth Warren,".@CommerceGov's process for exempting companies from Trump’s steel &amp; aluminum tariffs appears to be arbitrary, opaque, &amp; subject to favoritism. It’s run by 2 former industry insiders. I want more info on this potentially serious conflict of interest."
359,Elizabeth Warren,Fed Chair Jerome Powell is right: the opioid epidemic is a “national crisis.” That’s why @RepCummings &amp; I have the most ambitious legislation in Congress to put an end to it. #CAREact
360,Elizabeth Warren,"Facebook made $5 billion in profits in just the first three months of last year. The company is too big to oversee, and this drop-in-the-bucket penalty confirms that. The FTC should break Facebook up, plain and simple. Enough is enough."
361,Elizabeth Warren,"Let’s be honest: this settlement is a victory for Facebook. Just look to the markets. In the first 15 minutes after the settlement was reported, Facebook’s market value went up by more than $5 billion."
362,Elizabeth Warren,The FTC just voted to let Facebook off easy with a $5 billion settlement for compromising the data of tens of millions of Americans and allowing our elections to be improperly
363,Elizabeth Warren,"Private, for-profit prisons are rife with safety, health, and human rights concerns. We should abolish them altogether."
364,Elizabeth Warren,I want @ICEGov to explain to me why they’re spending even more money on for-profit detention centers &amp; secretly housing migrants in a facility so despicable that @TheJusticeDept didn’t want to use it.
365,Elizabeth Warren,The last thing our servicemembers should have to worry about is our govt trying to deport their families. @gillibrandny &amp; I wrote a letter urging @realDonaldTrump to think about our nat’l security &amp; reconsider deporting undocumented families of soldiers.
366,Elizabeth Warren,"Según los informes, @realDonaldTrump ha ordenado a @ICEgov que comience este fin de semana redadas a familias migrantes. No importa quién sea el presidente, independientemente de su estado migratorio, usted tiene derechos. Lea y comparta esta información. #KnowYourRights"
367,Elizabeth Warren,". @realDonaldTrump has reportedly directed @ICEgov to begin raids this weekend against thousands of migrant families. No matter who's President, regardless of your immigration status, you have rights. Read &amp; share this info from @ACLU. #KnowYourRights"
368,Elizabeth Warren,.@NLRB member William Emanuel got busted once for hearing a case where he had a conflict of interest — &amp; he might do it again. The NLRB is supposed to protect workers &amp; Emanuel’s mile-long list of conflicts is disqualifying. He must resign.
369,Elizabeth Warren,"Let's get this straight: @ICEgov spent money it doesn't have for a secret contract to detain migrants in a facility so horrendous that @TheJusticeDept stopped using it? We need to end private prisons &amp; detention centers, and stop the inhumane detention at the border. NOW."
370,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m reintroducing my Climate Risk Disclosure Act with @RepCasten, @RepCartwright &amp; @RepAOC to make public companies disclose their climate-related risks. Investors can hold corporations accountable for their role in the climate crisis &amp; speed up the transition to a green economy."
371,Elizabeth Warren,It’s time to wake up &amp; fight back against giant corporations that pollute our environment &amp; make everyone else deal with the consequences. So I’ve got a bill to #ActOnClimate with the language that giant corporations understand best: money.
372,Elizabeth Warren,"The #ClimateCrisis threatens our air, water, &amp; health, but it could also trigger a global financial crisis. Rising sea levels, more extreme storms, &amp; water shortages are just a few of the many threats to our economy."
373,Elizabeth Warren,I reintroduced my Gambling Addiction Prevention Act with @SteveDaines &amp; @RepSusieLee so servicemembers &amp; vets struggling with gambling addiction can get the treatment they need. It's one more way we can honor their sacrifices by keeping them safe.
374,Elizabeth Warren,"There are more than 3000 slot machines at US military installations around the world, but the @DeptofDefense doesn't systematically screen for gambling disorder. That's dangerous for our servicemembers' health &amp; well-being, &amp; our national security. But I've got a bill for that."
375,Elizabeth Warren,"We should call our climate crisis what it is: an emergency. That’s why I support a climate emergency resolution, a #GreenNewDeal, protecting our public lands and coasts from drilling, and other big, bold actions to tackle it."
376,Elizabeth Warren,I’m proud that MA &amp; our @MassAGO Maura Healey is still leading the fight to stop the Trump administration from ripping away health care from millions of Americans. We’re in this fight all the way. #ProtectOurCare
377,Elizabeth Warren,"Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights. That’s why I support #MedicareForAll so families don’t go broke while begging insurance companies to get the care they need."
378,Elizabeth Warren,"The Trump administration is in court today in their never-ending crusade to destroy health care for millions of Americans. If they succeed, families like Chantel’s would go bankrupt. People would die. #ProtectOurCare"
379,Elizabeth Warren,The facts are clear: @RealDonaldTrump’s only environmental priority is to stuff the pockets of Big Oil &amp; Big Coal companies that deepen the #ClimateCrisis &amp; poison our water &amp; air.
380,Elizabeth Warren,"Wall Street is lobbying policymakers to weaken the rules for their new ways to trick &amp; trap people into debt. This time it's student debt – but we’ve seen this story before. That's why @RepKatiePorter, @RepPressley, and I have sounded the alarm."
381,Elizabeth Warren,"Mayor Bill Carpenter was a true champion for the City of Brockton, &amp; a devoted public servant. Bruce &amp; I send our prayers to Bill’s family &amp; the people of Brockton. We’ll be with you every step of the way."
382,Elizabeth Warren,I look forward to a response and hope Dr. @ScottGottliebMD will rectify his mistake &amp; resign from his position at @Pfizer. It would send a strong message about the importance of integrity of current &amp; former federal officials.
383,Elizabeth Warren,"As @US_FDA Commissioner, @ScottGottliebMD &amp; I worked together on a number of public health priorities. That’s why I found his new position on the Board of drug giant @Pfizer to be such a tough pill to swallow."
384,Elizabeth Warren,"I want @JPMorgan @Chase CEO Jamie Dimon to explain why his bank is reinstating harmful forced arbitration clauses, &amp; to reconsider their plans to resume exploiting their customers."
385,Elizabeth Warren,"This might sound wonky, but it’s important. If @Chase unfairly charges you a $5 fee, you’re probably not going to challenge them alone in a bank-friendly arbitration process. But you might join a class action – like customers did in 2012 to recover $110M."
386,Elizabeth Warren,Forced arbitration clauses are a fancy way for companies to force customers to waive their right to go to court when they’re cheated. And @JPMorgan @Chase just snuck them back into the fine print of their credit cards.
387,Elizabeth Warren,Watch @RepJudyChu’s story &amp; #DontLookAway. What’s happening at @DHSgov border detention facilities is inhumane.
388,Elizabeth Warren,"Late Friday, @BetsyDeVosED declared open season for swindlers &amp; crooks by quietly throwing the rules on #4profit colleges in the garbage. I won’t stop fighting to hold DeVos accountable for turning her back on students."
389,Elizabeth Warren,"During her confirmation, I asked @BetsyDeVosED if she would enforce rules that protect students from cheating #4profit schools. She hemmed &amp; hawed &amp; sent a terrifying message to students: you’re on your own."
390,Elizabeth Warren,"The @FCC should be working on behalf of American consumers, not giant telecom companies. @RepJayapal &amp; I want @AjitPaiFCC to explain the extent to which CSRIC may be corrupted by corporate influence."
391,Elizabeth Warren,.@POGOBlog found that a federal advisory panel tasked with making policy recs to the @FCC is stacked with corporate insiders. This is the definition of corruption: industry members writing the rules to benefit themselves &amp; their rich friends.
392,Elizabeth Warren,@CFPB @splcenter @RepKatiePorter @RepPressley Paul Watkins’ role at @CFPB lets him scrap anti-discrimination laws for tech companies that are supposed to protect LGBTQ consumers. @CFPBDirector Kraninger should explain how the former lawyer of a homophobic hate-group got this job.
393,Elizabeth Warren,"The @CFPB’s Director of the Office of Innovation was Senior Counsel at an anti-LGBTQ organization labeled as a hate-group by the @SPLCenter. @RepKatiePorter, @RepPressley &amp; I don’t think he should have a job at the CFPB."
394,Elizabeth Warren,"Whether @realDonaldTrump likes it or not, he needs Congressional authorization to wage war. That’s why I voted for @SenatorTomUdall &amp; Senator Tim Kaine’s amdt that prohibits war with Iran without approval from Congress. Americans don’t want another war in the Middle East."
395,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump and his band of war hawks @SecPompeo &amp; @AmbJohnBolton have brought us to the brink of war with Iran, which would have devastating consequences for the region and the world. This should terrify every American."
396,Elizabeth Warren,I wrote to @BalfourBeatty &amp; the @USAirForce for an explanation about how Balfour Beatty was able to falsify housing maintenance logs while the Air Force looked the other way. I want answers.
397,Elizabeth Warren,But it gets worse: the @USAirForce unit that oversees privatized housing ignored at least 18 warnings from local employees about false info in @BalfourBeatty maintenance logs. I have real concerns about how the Air Force is using its oversight authorities.
398,Elizabeth Warren,.@BalfourBeatty got paid millions to operate housing on America's military bases – and it systematically falsified maintenance logs to collect huge bonuses while military families lived in unsafe &amp; unsanitary homes. It's shameful.
399,Elizabeth Warren,"Let’s be clear: @realDonaldTrump’s nakedly partisan citizenship question is a scheme to undercount, underfund &amp; dilute the political power of communities of color. Today’s SCOTUS ruling proves this isn’t over. We must keep fighting to count every single person in the #2020census."
400,Elizabeth Warren,Today the Supreme Court threw up its hands &amp; declared it can’t rein in partisan gerrymandering – can’t protect Americans’ constitutional rights to participate in their democracy equally &amp; choose their representatives. It's a shameful blow to the functioning of our democracy.
401,Elizabeth Warren,It’s time for the Senate to pass the #EqualityAct to finally ban discrimination against LGBTQ people. And Congress should pass my Refund Equality Act so legally married same-sex couples can finally get the tax refunds they should have received but were denied.
402,Elizabeth Warren,"Today we celebrate 4 years since Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark SCOTUS ruling for #MarriageEquality. We celebrate – but we also remember that our LGBTQ friends &amp; family are still fighting for “equal dignity in the eyes of the law” at work, school, &amp; in our communities."
403,Elizabeth Warren,@USDOL Today I led my @SenateDems colleagues in urging @USDOL to reverse course on joint employer agreements. The Labor Dept should be leading the fight to protect US workers – not undermining wage-and-hour protections for our most vulnerable.
404,Elizabeth Warren,"Giant corporations try to shirk responsibility for following federal labor laws by using contract workers, temps, &amp; franchises – &amp; @USDOL is trying to help them. Their proposal to narrow the definition of “employer” would weaken workers' wage protections."
405,Elizabeth Warren,What @realDonaldTrump's admin is doing is intentional cruelty – a deliberate attempt to destroy families and psychologically scar children. Shame on @realDonaldTrump &amp; shame on his @SenateGOP allies who have done his bidding on these horrific policies.
406,Elizabeth Warren,We should ban for-profit detention centers &amp; prisons. We should decriminalize migration. Parents &amp; children shouldn’t be deemed criminals for fleeing violence or seeking a better future. And we must stop family separation &amp; jailing children. Period.
407,Elizabeth Warren,We have a moral obligation to condemn &amp; end the despicable human rights abuses at detention facilities under @realDonaldTrump’s orders. I won't support a bill that lets companies continue to profit off of jailing children &amp; allows kids to remain in unlicensed facilities.
408,Elizabeth Warren,"Right now, kids are locked in cages &amp; dying in US custody, @realDonaldTrump is terrorizing communities with raids &amp; mass deportation, &amp; the @WhiteHouse is threatening to veto legislation if it leaves out funding for more @ICEgov detention. Congress must fight back."
409,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m glad students cheated by shady for-profit colleges are fighting back against @BetsyDeVosED in court. If she doesn’t care about helping defrauded students, then let’s hope a federal judge will make her care."
410,Elizabeth Warren,"One year ago, I was in McAllen to see the families ripped apart by the Trump admin. A year later, his administration is fighting to make sure the kids held in those cages don’t have soap or toothbrushes. This is a humanitarian crisis, and @realDonaldTrump is responsible for it."
411,Elizabeth Warren,Climate change deniers like @VP Pence may think we can bury our heads in the sand &amp; flat-out lie that “America has the cleanest air &amp; water in the world.” But the climate crisis is a national security threat.
412,Elizabeth Warren,"“While the plan is technically universal, it really does seem geared toward alleviating the current burdens of the poor and lower-middle class.” #UniversalChildCare"
413,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m deeply worried about the volume &amp; severity with which @ICEgov appears to be violating its own solitary confinement rules, &amp; the health &amp; safety of detainees in ICE's care. Today I’m demanding answers."
414,Elizabeth Warren,"Solitary confinement is a cruel &amp; unnecessary practice. It's appalling that @ICEgov misuses it in immigrant detention centers, including for people with mental or physical disabilities, sexual assault or torture victims, &amp; LGBTQ people."
415,Elizabeth Warren,One of @HUDgov’s most important jobs is to fight housing discrimination &amp; close the homeownership gap for people of color. Eric Blankenstein’s history of racist writings show that he is unfit for a job at HUD.
416,Elizabeth Warren,The crisis with Iran is a result of @realDonaldTrump provoking Iran’s extreme hardliners &amp; alienating our allies. I cosponsored @SenatorTomUdall’s amdt to the defense bill that prohibits war with Iran without Congressional approval. We can't start another war in the Middle East.
417,Elizabeth Warren,"Great news: thanks to @RepJudyChu &amp; @RepRichardNeal’s leadership in the House, the @WaysMeansCmte just passed the Refund Equality Act!"
418,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s been almost 4 months since the House passed a commonsense bill to require background checks for every gun sale – but the @SenateGOP haven’t done a thing. Listen to @GabbyGiffords, @SenateMajLdr McConnell. Our kids’ safety can’t wait another day. #BackgroundChecksNow"
419,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ve met with refugees from Syria, Iraq, &amp; Central America – moms, dads, kids, young people – fleeing terrorists &amp; gangs to seek a better life. On #WorldRefugeeDay, we reaffirm our values by fighting this administration’s hate-fueled attack on immigrants &amp; refugees."
420,Elizabeth Warren,The Refund Equality Act allows same-sex couples to claim the tax refunds they earned but were denied because of who they love. Tune in to the House markup of the bill now:
421,Elizabeth Warren,"For years, legally married same-sex couples couldn’t file joint taxes &amp; often paid more. I’m reintroducing my Refund Equality Act with 39 other senators to right that wrong."
422,Elizabeth Warren,"When antitrust regulators let giant corporations put profits over workers &amp; consumers, this is what happens. Disney is on track to make $9 BILLION at the box office in 2019. CEO Bob Iger took home $65.7M last year. And workers are facing layoffs."
423,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ll keep fighting in Washington to pass the #RaisetheWage Act, which would help ensure that all American workers, including tipped workers, make a living wage and have dignity at work."
424,Elizabeth Warren,"The federal minimum wage for tipped workers has been frozen at $2.13 since George HW Bush was President. MA can step up &amp; lead with #1fairwage because full-time work shouldn’t mean full-time poverty, financial uncertainty, and harassment on the job."
425,Elizabeth Warren,"On #Juneteenth, we remember that our country still hasn’t made enough progress toward racial equality &amp; justice. Voter suppression. Mass incarceration. Decades of govt discrimination to keep Black families from building wealth. We can, &amp; must, do better."
426,Elizabeth Warren,This important study from the @NLIHC shows what we already know – too many families across MA are stretched to the breaking point just to afford housing. Congress should treat the shortage of affordable housing like the crisis it is &amp; pass my housing bill.
427,Elizabeth Warren,"@DeptofDefense The Trump admin has outsourced leadership of the Pentagon to the defense industry. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would slam shut the revolving door so there wouldn’t be any question that the Pentagon is working for our national security, not the profits of giant defense companies."
428,Elizabeth Warren,Trump’s new Acting @DeptofDefense Secretary is a former Raytheon lobbyist who wouldn’t commit to fully recusing himself on matters related to his former employer when I questioned him 19 months ago.
429,Elizabeth Warren,"In the wealthiest country in the world, access to affordable, high-quality child care &amp; early ed should be a right for all families – not a privilege for only the rich. Congress should pass our #UniversalChildCare bill to invest in our kids &amp; make this economy work for everyone."
430,Elizabeth Warren,Massachusetts families pay an average of $20k/yr for infant center care – more than the cost of in-state public tuition at UMass. My #UniversalChildCare bill would help 100k low-income kids in MA &amp; thousands more above the poverty line.
431,Elizabeth Warren,@RepDebHaaland My new #UniversalChildCare bill with @RepDebHaaland would:✔️ Guarantee high-quality child care options for every family✔️ Make child care free for millions &amp; affordable for every family✔️ Invest in child care workers✔️ Provide universal pre-K education
432,Elizabeth Warren,"Like a lot of working parents, I struggled to find good, affordable child care. Nobody should have to feel like they’re failing their kids. That’s why @RepDebHaaland &amp; I have a plan – AND a bill – for #UniversalChildCare for every child in America."
433,Elizabeth Warren,President Trump’s Texas District Court nominee claimed that being transgender is a “delusion.” That narrow-minded bigotry deserves no place on the federal judiciary. The Senate must stand with the trans community and reject Matthew Kacsmaryk’s nomination.
434,Elizabeth Warren,Our government isn’t here to help powerful corporations get even more powerful. Our government is here to work for all families.
435,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ve got a bill with @RepCummings, @CongressmanRaja, &amp; @MarkWarner to impose massive, mandatory fines when companies like @Equifax expose people’s personal data. The govt should help prevent data breaches, not leave Americans vulnerable to identity theft."
436,Elizabeth Warren,"The government needs to be better &amp; smarter about protecting Americans’ personal information. @RepCummings, @RonWyden &amp; I want @DeptVetAffairs, @CMSGov, @USPS, &amp; @SocialSecurity to explain why they haven’t made improvements to protect consumer data &amp; when they plan to do so."
437,Elizabeth Warren,"This is a nightmare: almost 2 years after the massive @Equifax data breach, 4 govt agencies are still using an outdated process that relies on credit reporting agency data to verify people’s ID. They're putting Americans at even greater risk for fraud."
438,Elizabeth Warren,"All of the credible scientific evidence demonstrates that modern vaccines are safe, effective, and our best chance of protecting our children from diseases that can kill them."
439,Elizabeth Warren,I’m glad to be an original cosponsor of @PattyMurray’s bill to #FreeThePill.
440,Elizabeth Warren,"@FreddieMac @SenatorCarper My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would force ALL @WhiteHouse staff &amp; advisers, paid or unpaid, to follow basic ethics rules. That includes forcing senior White House advisors to fully divest from their family’s commercial real estate companies."
441,Elizabeth Warren,Jared Kushner didn’t fully divest from Kushner Co &amp; now @FreddieMac is guaranteeing an $800M loan to the company. @SenatorCarper &amp; I have concerns about Kushner’s conflicts of interests &amp; if the company got special treatment.
442,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s time for us to decide: Are we going to be a country that only helps the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful, or are we going to be a country that invests in its future? Our #CancelMyDebt bill will do better for students, families, &amp; our economy."
443,Elizabeth Warren,My student debt bill with @WhipClyburn will:✅Cancel up to $50k in student loan debt for 42M Americans✅Help close the racial wealth gap ✅Provide meaningful access to bankruptcy relief for student borrowers#CancelMyDebt
444,Elizabeth Warren,"I graduated from a public commuter college that cost $50/semester, &amp; it opened a million doors for me. But today, we’re crushing students with debt. This crisis is real – and @WhipClyburn &amp; I have a plan to fix it. #CancelMyDebt"
445,Elizabeth Warren,"Surprise, surprise: @realDonaldTrump’s pick to head @USCIS has compared immigrants to rats and spent his career peddling dangerous, anti-immigrant policies. Ken Cuccinelli is unfit to lead the agency tasked with fulfilling America’s promise as a nation of immigrants."
446,Elizabeth Warren,"Algorithms now determine who can get a mortgage, credit card, or bank account, &amp; the terms of those financial products. I want to know what the @federalreserve, @USOCC, @FDICgov &amp; @CFPB are doing to ensure lending algorithms are fair &amp; nondiscriminatory."
447,Elizabeth Warren,"For generations, lenders have given African American &amp; Latino families fewer loans at worse terms than similar white borrowers. Tech alone won’t fix the problem. A new analysis found that discrimination is hardwired into lending algorithms. I want answers."
448,Elizabeth Warren,We need to padlock the revolving door between big business &amp; government to get our democracy working for the people again. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would force former corporate lobbyists like Charles Faulkner to take a 6-year time-out before taking a job in government.
449,Elizabeth Warren,".@RepTedLieu &amp; I have urged the @StateOIG to investigate Charles Faulkner’s conduct, including whether he violated his ethics pledge &amp; any federal ethics laws during his govt service. Officials should work for the American people, not their former defense contractor clients."
450,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump is more interested in appeasing US defense contractors than holding Saudi Arabia accountable for one of the world’s worst humanitarian catastrophes.
451,Elizabeth Warren,"Former @StateDept official Charles Faulkner helped the Trump administration bypass Congress to fast track arms sales to Saudi Arabia &amp; the UAE – including arms made by Raytheon, his former lobbying client. That’s blatant government corruption."
452,Elizabeth Warren,"The @USWNT is #1 in the world &amp; contributes higher revenues for @USSoccer than the men’s team, but they’re still paid a fraction of what the men earn. Women deserve equal pay for equal (or better!) work in offices, factories, AND on the soccer field."
453,Elizabeth Warren,"The House passed the #SaveTheInternet Act to restore #NetNeutrality, &amp; @senatemajldr buried it in his legislative graveyard. The internet doesn’t belong to giant companies – it belongs to all of us. I’m joining @SenMarkey &amp; @SenateDems to demand a vote for a free &amp; open internet."
454,Elizabeth Warren,"@TheJusticeDept Consumers &amp; markets deserve confidence that @TheJusticeDept will conduct antitrust investigations into Google, Apple or any company with integrity &amp; impartiality. That’s why my bill to #EndCorruptionNow would shut down the revolving door between big business &amp; the government."
455,Elizabeth Warren,The head of the antitrust division at @TheJusticeDept should not be supervising investigations into Apple or Google – former clients who paid him tens of thousands of dollars to lobby the federal govt. Makan Delrahim should recuse himself.
456,Elizabeth Warren,"Giant coal companies are cheating taxpayers into giving them tax subsidies intended for technologies that truly reduce emissions. @SenWhitehouse, @SenSherrodBrown &amp; I want the IRS to explain why the Trump admin is letting this happen."
457,Elizabeth Warren,I’ve got a bill for that. My affordable housing plan will build 3M+ new housing units AND create a competitive grant program as an incentive for local governments to eliminate unnecessary zoning laws &amp; land use restrictions that drive up costs.
458,Elizabeth Warren,"Happy #Pride, Boston! It’s my favorite day of the year because it’s the day we celebrate love. Don’t just march in #BostonPride today – DANCE. Be #wickedproud of who you are because our diversity makes our Commonwealth &amp; our country stronger."
459,Elizabeth Warren,"The accreditation system for private detention centers is an utter sham. I wrote last week to private prisons, @DHSgov &amp; the accreditors looking for answers, but one thing is already clear: we need real accountability to protect the lives of everyone detained at these facilities."
460,Elizabeth Warren,An independent investigator found dangerous violations of detention standards at four immigration detention facilities. And guess what? All four facilities are listed on @ACAinfo’s website as accredited institutions. This is
461,Elizabeth Warren,"On National Gun Violence Awareness Day, it’s time for the Senate to finally show some political courage &amp; vote on common-sense gun safety laws to protect our kids &amp; grandkids. We’re here to work for the people, not the @NRA. #wearorange"
462,Elizabeth Warren,I love #Pride because it's a time we all come together to celebrate love. I'll never stop fighting for a world where everyone feels safe to be who they are &amp; love who they love.
463,Elizabeth Warren,Congress should take the next step &amp; pass our Tax Filing Simplification Act to make filing taxes easier &amp; cheaper for all Americans.
464,Elizabeth Warren,"For years, giant tax prep companies have deliberately rigged the IRS program that is supposed to provide free filing services to pad their bottom lines instead. Taxpayers &amp; advocates fought back – &amp; stopped that broken program from being written into law."
465,Elizabeth Warren,"@DHSgov @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I launched an investigation w/ @RepJayapal on General Kelly joining the board of a company that runs the country’s largest detention center for migrant kids. Our anti-corruption bill would lock the revolving door to make these sorts of rapid, cynical, &amp; unethical actions illegal."
466,Elizabeth Warren,Former @DHSgov Secretary &amp; @WhiteHouse Chief of Staff John Kelly was at the center of @realDonaldTrump’s policies that separated families &amp; locked kids in cages. It’s outrageous that he’s now set to cash in on those inhumane policies at Caliburn.
467,Elizabeth Warren,"@MassGovernor @CAgovernor Our federal marijuana laws perpetuate our broken criminal justice system, impede research, restrict veterans' access &amp; hinder economic development. Marijuana should be legalized, &amp; I’ll work with anyone – GOP, Dem, Independent, Libertarian, vegetarian – to push for these reforms."
468,Elizabeth Warren,12 GOP &amp; Democratic governors – led by @MassGovernor Baker &amp; @CAgovernor Newsom – have endorsed my bipartisan bill to protect states’ right to enforce their own marijuana laws without federal interference. This is long overdue.
469,Elizabeth Warren,"On #DDay75thAnniversary, we remember the sacrifices of American and Allied troops to liberate Europe from the Nazi regime. We also remember that America is strong, but we are even stronger when we work with our allies to build a more peaceful world. #DDay75"
470,Elizabeth Warren,The new SEC rules make it easier for Wall St to cheat families out of their life savings. Workers are facing a retirement crisis. The last thing the SEC should do is give the green light for brokers &amp; advisers to trick people into buying harmful products.
471,Elizabeth Warren,"Unlike Big Tech, the American people can’t afford to hire an “army” of lobbyists to march on Capitol Hill when Washington isn’t working for them. That’s why my plan to #EndCorruptionNow would end lobbying as we know it."
472,Elizabeth Warren,"Betsy DeVos should focus on real solutions to the student debt crisis – not more ways to trick &amp; trap students in debt. @RepPressley, @RepKatiePorter &amp; I want answers about @usedgov’s ISA plans to determine if they’re acting in students’ best interest."
473,Elizabeth Warren,It's disturbing that @usedgov is exploring Income Share Agreements – student debt contracts that allow private investors to exploit students (especially students of color) as badly as some of the most predatory &amp; costly private student loans.
474,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s time to stop handing out tax breaks to Big Oil &amp; padding corporate profits at our communities’ expense. Investing in clean energy &amp; reducing carbon pollution are investments in our health, our environment, our national security, &amp; our economy. #climaterisks #climatecosts"
475,Elizabeth Warren,Even some giant multinational corporations are starting to disclose to their shareholders that climate change will have an enormous effect on their bottom line – &amp; I have a bill to force them all to fess up. #climatecosts
476,Elizabeth Warren,"The climate crisis poses an existential threat to our country &amp; our planet. We see #climaterisks every day: record floods. Devastating wildfires. Monster storms. It jeopardizes our air, water, homes, businesses, food, infrastructure, economy, &amp; national security. #climatecosts"
477,Elizabeth Warren,"Last year, Hurricane Florence tore through NC. Hurricane Michael ripped through FL. And floods put Plains states like NE underwater. It will cost US taxpayers billions of dollars just to repair three bases because of those storms. #climatecosts"
478,Elizabeth Warren,"We’re proud that Massachusetts leads the way on health care coverage. Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights."
479,Elizabeth Warren,"The House sent an important message today: we must protect Dreamers, TPS holders, &amp; DED beneficiaries from @realDonaldTrump’s racist, anti-immigrant agenda. The Senate should pass this bill immediately. https://t.co/UhM5cmWk3N #DreamAndPromiseNow"
480,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s been 2 months since the House voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act &amp; the @SenateGOP haven’t done a thing. Women – especially Native women &amp; women of color – can’t wait any longer, @senatemajldr. It’s time to vote on the House version of VAWA. #VAWA4ALL #HR1585"
481,Elizabeth Warren,Even Silicon Valley is cashing in on the Pentagon’s corrupt contracting system. My @DeptofDefense Ethics &amp; Anti-Corruption Act with @RepSpeier would lock the revolving door so that the Pentagon isn't working for the benefit of past-and-future employers.
482,Elizabeth Warren,"People always say that big change is impossible. That’s what they told the suffragettes – but they got organized, persisted, &amp; 100 years ago today, the Senate passed the 19th Amendment to give women the right to vote. We can change the course of history – if we fight for it."
483,Elizabeth Warren,"Massachusetts families are fighting for their lives against the opioid epidemic – and the federal government isn't doing enough to help. My plan, the #CAREact, would spend $100 billion on treatment, recovery, and research to end this crisis."
484,Elizabeth Warren,"@ICEgov @ACAinfo I'm opening an investigation into the accreditation process for private detention operators. If federal agencies rely on @ACAinfo for detainees' safety, they must be accountable for proper conditions before we hand these companies huge govt contracts."
485,Elizabeth Warren,@ICEgov The American Correctional Association is in charge of accrediting private prison facilities to ensure they meet basic standards. But @ACAinfo is ALSO the #1 trade association of the private prison industry. Those perverse incentives are a recipe for disaster.
486,Elizabeth Warren,".@ICEgov detains almost 50k immigrants – many in facilities run by for-profit companies. I’ve repeatedly pushed these contractors, auditors, &amp; ICE about their failure to protect the health &amp; safety of detainees. Today I’m taking another step."
487,Elizabeth Warren,Thousands of loyal @Sears employees lost their jobs because of Eddie Lampert. Now he’s trying to betray his promise to pay them the severance they earned. @RepAOC and I are demanding answers.
488,Elizabeth Warren,The CRS report confirmed what most Americans already knew: the #GOPTaxScam was a heist that stole from middle class families &amp; handed that money over to big campaign donors. That’s corruption. It’s long past time for the rich &amp; powerful to pay their fair share.
489,Elizabeth Warren,"So if they didn’t raise wages for workers or spend the money to grow the economy, what did CEOs use all of that #GOPTaxScam money for? Stock buybacks that artificially pump up the company’s stock price for wealthy shareholders."
490,Elizabeth Warren,Did people spend more money because of the #GOPTaxScam? Nope. Turns out that the ultra-rich who got those tax breaks don’t need even more money for yachts &amp; diamonds.
491,Elizabeth Warren,Did giant corporations use their #GOPTaxScam money to raise workers’ wages? Nope. No trickle-down here.
492,Elizabeth Warren,Did the #GOPTaxScam grow the economy? Nope.
493,Elizabeth Warren,"First off, let’s just be clear: The #GOPTaxScam helped giant corporations a heck of a lot more than middle class families. That’s a fact."
494,Elizabeth Warren,The #GOPTaxScam was a $1.5 trillion giveaway to billionaires &amp; giant corporations. That’s not a conspiracy theory or partisan attack. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service just ran the 2018 numbers. Let’s look at the facts:
495,Elizabeth Warren,"I struggled for years to juggle my family &amp; my teaching job. The constant search for good, affordable child care nearly knocked me out. Luckily, my Aunt Bee stepped in to help. But not every family has an Aunt Bee – and that’s why I’m fighting for #UniversalChildCare."
496,Elizabeth Warren,"Workers at @UMassMemorial provide life-saving care for people in Central MA. I’m very glad to see that @sharehospitalu1, @AFSCME &amp; UMass Memorial have ratified a new 4-yr contract that improves patient care, raises wages, &amp; strengthens workers' voices."
497,Elizabeth Warren,"If the companies that belong to the @USChamber and @ShopFloorNAM really support efforts to #ActOnClimate, they should put people over profits and stop funneling money to the #ChamberOfCarbon and other anti-climate lobbying groups."
498,Elizabeth Warren,This is bigger than 2 anti-climate lobbying groups – it’s also about the companies (many of which have made public commitments to fight climate change) that support them. They're putting their reputations – and our communities – at risk.
499,Elizabeth Warren,.@ShopFloorNAM has repeatedly opposed federal action on the climate crisis – and worked to protect Big Oil by supporting Arctic and offshore oil drilling and fighting the transition to a clean energy economy. #ManufacturedFacts.
500,Elizabeth Warren,The @USChamber has supported Trump Admin efforts to roll back the Clean Power Plan and funded a misleading study that @realDonaldTrump used to justify withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. It might as well change its name to the #ChamberOfCarbon.
501,Elizabeth Warren,What do the @USChamber and @ShopFloorNAM have in common? They’re 2 of corporate America’s top lobbying groups. And they’re both leading the charge to stop Congress from combatting the climate crisis and saving our planet.
502,Elizabeth Warren,"I read the Mueller Report. In fact, I re-read portions of it on the floor of the United States Senate. It should be crystal clear to anyone who read the report: Congress must hold the President"
503,Elizabeth Warren,".@BostonLogan airport workers keep us safe and get us where we need to go. I’m glad that @MassAGO is holding contractors accountable, and making sure workers are paid every penny they’ve earned."
504,Elizabeth Warren,"On #MemorialDay, we remember the brave women and men who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. We honor them by following through on the promises we made to their families, and all those who serve."
505,Elizabeth Warren,Selling more weapons to Saudi Arabia doesn't make America safer or align with our country's values. It only benefits defense contractors and @realDonaldTrump's alarming desire to sow chaos abroad. l'll do everything I can in Congress to stop it.
506,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump wants to keep selling American weapons to his Saudi buddies. But he knows Congress won't approve selling to a regime that's bombed thousands of Yemeni civilians and murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi – so he's trying to go around us.
507,Elizabeth Warren,This is a despicable act of cowardice. This vandalism is meant to divide us – but I know it only strengthens the resolve of the people of Dorchester and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to remember and honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice.
508,Elizabeth Warren,"Last week, @SenatorMenendez, @NydiaVelazquez &amp; I questioned @FEMA about the delays. Now, the agency has confirmed the hospital on Vieques will be rebuilt. It's a critical win for the people of Puerto Rico – and we’ll be with them every step of the way."
509,Elizabeth Warren,"For nearly 2 years, 9,000 US citizens living on the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico haven't had access to a local hospital. Theirs was destroyed in Hurricane Maria, and despite promises to rebuild, @FEMA kept delaying the project."
510,Elizabeth Warren,"Last night, I voted for a major bipartisan disaster relief package that will help people across the country recover from natural disasters like hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires. When we work together, our nation comes out on top."
511,Elizabeth Warren,"10 years ago this week, Congress passed a bipartisan bill to help get the tricks &amp; traps out of the fine print of credit card agreements – but the fight’s not over. We need a strong @CFPB to hold credit card companies accountable when they cheat customers &amp; break the law."
512,Elizabeth Warren,"I'm proud to cosponsor the Women’s Health Protection Act. It would #StopTheBans by enshrining Roe v. Wade into federal law – ensuring everyone in this country has access to abortion, no matter where they live. #ActForWomen"
513,Elizabeth Warren,I was wrong. It's not 5 children dead – it's SIX. The Trump Admin just disclosed a 10-yr-old girl died in federal custody last year.Are there more we don't know about? We need oversight. We need accountability. We need to do everything we can to keep this from happening again.
514,Elizabeth Warren,"I stand with @AOC, @forrespect, and the 250,000 workers who lost jobs and severance pay when Wall Street fat cats @StevenMnuchin1 and Eddie Lampert gutted companies like @Sears. Together, we'll keep fighting for justice, accountability, and better futures for all."
515,Elizabeth Warren,"Washington is supposed to work for everyone. Instead, the rich &amp; powerful like @StevenMnuchin1 &amp; Eddie Lampert use it to become even more rich &amp; powerful, while workers are left holding the bag. This is the DC swamp at its worst."
516,Elizabeth Warren,"Steven Mnuchin and his college roommate Eddie Lampert (the CEO of Sears) piled the company with debt, closed thousands of stores, and enriched themselves at the expense of workers. Now, @StevenMnuchin1 could have a say in decisions affecting @Sears."
517,Elizabeth Warren,"Before @StevenMnuchin1 became Treasury Secretary, he was on the board of @Sears, where he helped gut the company and fire thousands of employees. Now, @AOC and I have some tough questions for him."
518,Elizabeth Warren,It's been 48 days since the Violence Against Women Act passed the House. But @SenateMajLdr McConnell would rather help his @NRA buddies than bring #VAWA to the floor. This is ridiculous. Women's lives are more important than gun lobbyists' wish lists.
519,Elizabeth Warren,"In December I called for @DHSOIG to investigate these deaths at the border, and that review is underway. But we need answers now: why are children dying after being taken into @CBP custody and what steps is CBP taking to end this string of"
520,Elizabeth Warren,Two more immigrant children died over the past week after having been in @CBP custody. That’s five deaths in the past six months. It’s appalling. CBP owes the American people an explanation for these children’s deaths and its failure to keep them safe.
521,Elizabeth Warren,Not on my watch. I’m cosponsoring legislation to stop us from going to war with Iran. Congress must use its constitutional authority to stop @realDonaldTrump from dragging us into another forever war.
522,Elizabeth Warren,Americans are tired of reckless and endless wars. We saw what the disastrous Iraq War did. Thousands of servicemembers dead and wounded. America's reputation damaged abroad. Now @realDonaldTrump’s advisors are pushing Shock and Awe 2.0 – this time against Iran.
523,Elizabeth Warren,".@SecretaryCarson can’t distinguish between a cookie and a home that’s been foreclosed on. Luckily, @RepKatiePorter was able to school him on the difference."
524,Elizabeth Warren,Republican state legislators are already stripping away women's constitutional rights. And @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SenateGOP are making their jobs easier by appointing judges who could overturn Roe v. Wade. I'll be voting no on every one of these guys.
525,Elizabeth Warren,"Kenneth Bell once argued the ""indefensibility of the abortion rights position,"" claiming there was ""no middle ground."" Thanks to the @SenateGOP, he could wind up on the federal bench in North Carolina, where legislators have already considered an anti-abortion bill this year."
526,Elizabeth Warren,"Carl Nichols, @realDonaldTrump's nominee to be a Judge in the District of Washington DC, argued that pharmacists should be able to deny patients access to emergency contraceptives (which they're required by law to provide) because of religious objections."
527,Elizabeth Warren,"It gets worse. Stephen Clark sponsored an ad calling Roe v. Wade “BAD LAW” &amp; comparing it to Dred Scott, a heinous Supreme Court decision that deprived Black Americans of their constitutional rights. No wonder Republicans want him on the federal bench."
528,Elizabeth Warren,"Howard Nielson, nominee to be a Judge for the District of Utah, defended a highly restrictive Texas law that would have prevented countless women from accessing abortions. The Supreme Court disagreed and ultimately struck it down."
529,Elizabeth Warren,Daniel Collins argued in a brief submitted in the Hobby Lobby case that companies should be able to deny contraceptive coverage to employees. Now @SenateGOP and @realDonaldTrump want him on the Ninth Circuit.
530,Elizabeth Warren,"Last week, Alabama passed an extreme abortion ban in a thinly veiled attempt to overturn Roe v. Wade. This week, @SenateGOP is trying to shove through 5 judges who have spent their careers undermining women's reproductive rights. This is a full-scale attack on women's health."
531,Elizabeth Warren,It’s been over 24 hours. No more spoiler alerts. Here’s why @AOC and I are officially on #TeamSansa now.
532,Elizabeth Warren,"Patients with mental health &amp; substance use disorders deserve the same access to care as patients with physical health conditions, but insurance companies deny these services to cut costs. @RepJoeKennedy &amp; I have a plan so people get the care they need."
533,Elizabeth Warren,"A group of lawyers, professors &amp; judges are about to vote on whether to subject consumers to abusive contracts they don't negotiate and can't opt out of. This dangerous proposal will shape decisions in courts across the country – it should be voted down."
534,Elizabeth Warren,I introduced this legislation to help provide tribal nations with the resources they need to combat child abuse &amp; neglect. I’m very grateful for @NCAI1944 &amp; @NativeChildren's support of this bill.
535,Elizabeth Warren,The @CFPB and @usedgov are supposed to protect students from loan companies that break the law. But @BetsyDeVosED has given these companies the green light to ignore regulators’ oversight. Students deserve better than this.
536,Elizabeth Warren,Rising carbon dioxide levels are driving the climate crisis &amp; threaten the safety of every American. But @SecBernhardt “hasn’t lost any sleep over it.” We need an @Interior Secretary who cares more about our environment than the profits of his former and future lobbying clients.
537,Elizabeth Warren,"These actions are meant to inspire fear in places of worship and joy. But we won’t let that happen. By coming together to stand against anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry, our communities will only grow stronger."
538,Elizabeth Warren,"Exactly 15 years after Massachusetts became the first state to legalize gay marriage, the House has passed the #EqualityAct. I'll fight to do the same in the Senate. Because LGBTQ Americans deserve to be treated equally, no matter where they live – or who they love."
539,Elizabeth Warren,"Over and over again, I’ve spoken out against right-wing efforts to ban abortion. Now it's time for Congress to act. I have a plan to secure women’s access to reproductive care through federal, statutory rights that parallel Roe’s protections. Let’s #StopTheBans."
540,Elizabeth Warren,"We have two separate &amp; very unequal justice systems: one for the wealthy &amp; well connected, &amp; one for everyone else. Read my new essay with the @BrennanCenter on how we enforce the principle engraved on the Supreme Court: ""Equal Justice Under Law."""
541,Elizabeth Warren,"This student loan company is literally under investigation and being sued by states and the federal government for cheating students to make more money. But congrats on breaking into the #Fortune500, @Navient. I didn’t know they had a special section for scammers."
542,Elizabeth Warren,"Tomorrow is the anniversary of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education. 65 years later, Wendy Vitter, @realDonaldTrump’s pick for the LA District Court, won't say whether that case was correctly decided. The Senate must reject her nomination.#CourtsMatter"
543,Elizabeth Warren,"The defense industry will inevitably have a seat at the table, but they shouldn’t get to own the table. US security &amp; values must come ahead of private companies' profits. Congress should stand up to the military industrial complex &amp; pass the DOD Ethics &amp; Anti-Corruption Act."
544,Elizabeth Warren,My bill with @RepSpeier would:-Slam shut the revolving door between defense contractors &amp; the Pentagon -Ban DOD officials from owning defense contractor stock-Limit foreign gov’ts from hiring former US national security officials-Increase transparency of lobbying
545,Elizabeth Warren,Our national security decisions should be driven only by what best keeps Americans safe – not by what makes the defense industry the most money. That’s why I’m introducing new legislation to loosen the stranglehold defense contractors have on the Pentagon and #EndCorruptionNow.
546,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ve said it for years: state &amp; federal efforts to defund @PPFA, gut Title X &amp; ban abortion are part of a deliberate, methodical, orchestrated attack on women’s rights. We’ll fight back for reproductive care – including access to safe &amp; legal abortion – as many times as it takes."
547,Elizabeth Warren,"The @USOCC has the authority to review @WellsFargo's pick for a new CEO. But they didn't use it when Tim Sloan was put in charge. I got Comptroller Otting to agree to review Sloan's successor, &amp; urged him to make that info public so Americans can hold Wells (&amp; him) accountable."
548,Elizabeth Warren,"Alabama lawmakers have voted to effectively ban abortion in the state. We see this for what it is: a direct attack on Roe v. Wade, and on women all across this country. We will fight these attacks every step of the way."
549,Elizabeth Warren,We cannot let the Trump Admin drag us into yet another war in the Middle East. This is exactly why the President doesn't have the constitutional authority to declare war. That's Congress’s job – and that's why I'm supporting this legislation to prevent a war with Iran.
550,Elizabeth Warren,I support the #EqualityAct because nobody should be discriminated against for who they are or who they love – period.
551,Elizabeth Warren,"If we want to stop Wall Street banks &amp; giant companies from cheating customers, hurting workers, &amp; polluting our planet, we can’t sit back &amp; do nothing. We have to hold corporate criminals accountable. I’ve introduced legislation that would do just that."
552,Elizabeth Warren,"After @realDonaldTrump took office, the number of white collar crime enforcement actions pursued by the federal gov't declined to a 20-year-low. Fines and enforcement actions have dropped across nearly every agency. Cases brought by the @CFPB, SEC, &amp; DOJ have dropped by 50%."
553,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s already clear that our gov't is rigged in favor of the rich and powerful. But in case you need a refresher, @RepJayapal and I have a new report outlining how the Trump Admin is letting corporate criminals run rampant."
554,Elizabeth Warren,"Dr. @YngvildOlsen is absolutely right. It's time to end the discrimination and fear surrounding addiction, and instead respond with courage. It's time for Congress to pass the #CAREact."
555,Elizabeth Warren,"Four years ago, @DrLeanaWen came to my Senate office &amp; trained me in the use of naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal drug. Our #CAREact includes $500 million/yr of funding to expand access to this life-saving medicine."
556,Elizabeth Warren,"The biggest drug companies have made billions of dollars pushing powerful &amp; addictive drugs that contribute to our opioid epidemic. When drug manufacturers break the law, their execs should be held personally accountable. My corporate accountability bill will make sure of it."
557,Elizabeth Warren,"Insys Therapeutics made a spray out of the powerful opioid fentanyl for cancer patients, illegally marketed it to people with milder pain, &amp; bribed doctors to overprescribe it. Their former CEO John Kapoor &amp; 4 other executives are going to jail."
558,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m happy to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with @RepLoriTrahan for families in Central MA, the Merrimack Valley, &amp; all across this country. Great to see everyone at #MA3InDC today!"
559,Elizabeth Warren,"Long before I was a senator, I fought to keep student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy – but Congress chipped away at this critical protection. I’m glad to work with @SenatorDurbin on the Student Borrower Bankruptcy Relief Act to restore this protection."
560,Elizabeth Warren,Let’s do it! #CAREact
561,Elizabeth Warren,.@CNNBusiness let me explain (in more than 280 characters) why that @Chase tweet last week was a punch in the gut – it perpetuates the myth that irresponsible spending is the reason for Americans’ dire financial straits. (Spoiler alert: It's not.)
562,Elizabeth Warren,"Uber &amp; Lyft are worth billions of dollars, but their business model depends, in part, on low wages for their drivers. I stand with ride-sharing workers who are organizing for better pay &amp; benefits &amp; the opportunity to bargain collectively."
563,Elizabeth Warren,"Congress needs to stand up to the #ChamberOfCarbon. And companies need to start walking the talk. If they really support efforts to combat climate change, they shouldn’t keep funneling money to the @USChamber while Big Oil uses it to do its dirty work."
564,Elizabeth Warren,"The @USChamber has spent millions since 2010 to support climate-denying Republicans. But when @SenWhitehouse and I surveyed the Chamber’s board members, not a single one would endorse the org’s anti-climate position. So where’s the money coming from?"
565,Elizabeth Warren,"The #CAREact is the most ambitious legislation ever introduced in Congress to confront the opioid epidemic, &amp; that's why 200+ organizations support this bill. It’s long past time for the federal government to step up &amp; take action."
566,Elizabeth Warren,"Construction workers are 6 times more likely to die of opioid overdoses than any other job, so the #CAREact has a new grant program to help high-risk workers. I’m proud that labor groups including the @AFLCIO &amp; @NABTU support our bill to fight this crisis."
567,Elizabeth Warren,"In Massachusetts, 1 in 4 people know someone who has died of an opioid overdose – but our communities just don’t have the resources to help everyone who needs it. Under our #CAREact, MA would receive $120.1 million to fight substance use disorders &amp; the opioid epidemic."
568,Elizabeth Warren,"30 years ago, the Ryan White CARE Act transformed the fight against HIV/AIDS. Our new #CAREact to fight the opioid crisis is modeled on that bill – &amp; invests $100 billion in states &amp; local communities for prevention, treatment, &amp; recovery services."
569,Elizabeth Warren,130 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose. That’s like a plane crash every day. This is a public health emergency – &amp; @RepCummings &amp; I have a bold plan to fight it. #CAREact
570,Elizabeth Warren,"A year ago today, the Trump admin made family separation the official policy of the US. I saw firsthand how that policy was cruelly carried out – children separated from their mothers in detention. We won't stop fighting #UntilEveryFamilyIsReunited."
571,Elizabeth Warren,"Enough is enough. Credit reporting agencies like @Equifax collect our information without our permission. If they allow that information to get stolen, they need to be held accountable. My colleagues &amp; I urged the @FTC &amp; the @CFPB to do just that."
572,Elizabeth Warren,".@Equifax didn’t just allow the breach to happen. It also initially refused to come clean with the public &amp; help consumers protect themselves. And according to a new Congressional report, the company is STILL failing consumers months later."
573,Elizabeth Warren,".@Equifax let hackers steal personal info from almost 150 million Americans. If this bill had been the law before the breach, the company would have paid at least $1.5 billion in fines, half of which would have gone straight back to affected consumers."
574,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s been nearly 2 years since the #EquifaxBreach – &amp; Congress still hasn’t acted to protect consumers or prevent the next breach. So @MarkWarner @RepCummings, @CongressmanRaja &amp; I are reintroducing a bill to impose massive, mandatory fines when companies expose personal data."
575,Elizabeth Warren,"You and I both took an oath, @SenateMajLdr McConnell. To defend the Constitution of the United States – not to protect @realDonaldTrump. Congress must consider the evidence provided in the Mueller Report and hold the President accountable."
576,Elizabeth Warren,"I grew up to be a teacher, then a senator – in no small part because of Mrs. Lee, my 2nd grade teacher. She opened the door to a world of opportunity for me. If we want to invest in brighter futures for our kids, we must invest more in our teachers today. #TeacherAppreciationWeek"
577,Elizabeth Warren,"Home care workers deserve higher wages, better benefits, and stronger collective bargaining rights. But the Trump Admin is trying to roll back their rights. I'm in this fight with #homecare workers – and the Americans who rely on their care – all the way."
578,Elizabeth Warren,"Murder rates for Native women &amp; girls are horrifyingly high. This is a crisis. On National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, we renew our commitment to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, &amp; ending this epidemic of violence. #MMIWG"
579,Elizabeth Warren,"My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would stop senior govt officials from leaving &amp; immediately getting paid by firms they gave contracts to. I’ll keep fighting to make that law. In the meantime, Kelly should try &amp; save what’s left of his reputation by resigning from Caliburn’s board."
580,Elizabeth Warren,John Kelly oversaw many of the Trump Admin's most morally repugnant immigration policies. Now he could be making big bucks serving on the Board of a company that's profiting from the same cruel plans he put in place. This is corruption at its absolute worst.
581,Elizabeth Warren,"Construction workers are some of the toughest people I know, but the back-breaking work means too many get hurt, become addicted to opioids &amp; die of overdoses. I'm grateful that the MA Building Trades are tackling this crisis. We're in this fight together."
582,Elizabeth Warren,"Congress may not have the courage yet to pass real gun reforms – but @GabbyGiffords has plenty of courage to spare. Grateful for @GiffordsCourage’s leadership and tireless efforts to #EndGunViolence, and to be with Gabby in this fight. We can do this, together."
583,Elizabeth Warren,"The FTC should investigate if hiding Free File is unfair &amp; deceptive, and if the companies colluded to rip off taxpayers. And IRS should end its agreements with them &amp; get refunds for taxpayers who paid for services because of these abuses."
584,Elizabeth Warren,It gets worse: A @propublica report &amp; an investigation by my office found that nearly half of the IRS’s Free File companies hide the free option in online search results &amp; direct people to paid products instead. It’s unfair &amp; deceptive.
585,Elizabeth Warren,The IRS’s Free File program claims to provide free tax prep services to 70% of taxpayers. But only 3% of eligible taxpayers use it because the companies trick people into purchasing unnecessary products. (That’s why I’ve got a plan to overhaul it.)
586,Elizabeth Warren,The private firms that own &amp; operate military housing are cutting corners to make a profit on the homes of four-star generals. What do you think they’re doing to the homes of junior enlisted? That’s why @RepDebHaaland &amp; I have a plan to fix it.
587,Elizabeth Warren,"We must be vigilant about the threat of terrorism, but no one believes that there is a military-only solution in Afghanistan. We need an economic &amp; diplomatic plan with our allies for safety &amp; stability in the region. And it’s time to bring our troops home — now."
588,Elizabeth Warren,The Trump administration owes it to the American people &amp; our service members to define what winning is in Afghanistan &amp; how we achieve that goal. The evidence is abundantly clear: this administration has no plan.
589,Elizabeth Warren,"Today I’m reintroducing the US Territorial Relief Act to give US territories like Puerto Rico a route to comprehensive debt relief &amp; a chance to get back on their feet. Our fellow US citizens are counting on us, &amp; we cannot forget them."
590,Elizabeth Warren,"Now, post-Maria, Puerto Rico faces a much bigger crisis. Rebuilding efforts in Puerto Rico are still slow, &amp; the debt is a big reason why. Few investors want to put money into reconstruction if the debt means the island doesn’t have a realistic chance of recovering."
591,Elizabeth Warren,"Puerto Rico was in crisis long before Hurricanes Maria &amp; Irma tore through the island. For years, Puerto Rico has been at the mercy of Wall Street vulture funds that snapped up the island’s crushing debt to squeeze the Puerto Rican people for every penny they can get."
592,Elizabeth Warren,"On Yom Hashoa, #WeRemember the 6 million Jews and millions of others who were murdered in the Holocaust. We honor their memories by speaking out and confronting anti-Semitism, bigotry, and hate – wherever we find it."
593,Elizabeth Warren,Our military families deserve high-quality housing. I’ve introduced the Military Housing Oversight &amp; Service Member Protection Act to help fix the private housing program's shortcomings &amp; eliminate the corner-cutting &amp; neglect by providers.
594,Elizabeth Warren,"The failure of private housing companies to meet basic standards for military housing is unacceptable. My office conducted an investigation of the private housing program &amp; found a series of problems in the structure, administration, &amp; oversight."
595,Elizabeth Warren,My friend @maziehirono always speaks truth to power. 🔥 Thanks to @JudiciaryDems for asking the tough questions.
596,Elizabeth Warren,The Attorney General does not swear an oath of loyalty to any one individual. The AG swears an oath of loyalty to the Constitution of the United States. Barr has made clear that he doesn't swear his loyalty that way &amp; that disqualifies him from being AG. He should resign.
597,Elizabeth Warren,"Sending my best wishes to Rutland’s own Drew Pescaro &amp; all of the victims of the tragic shooting at UNC Charlotte yesterday. Stay strong, Drew. #drewstrong"
598,Elizabeth Warren,"Earlier this month, @SenJackReed &amp; I urged the @USGAO to investigate the national security risks posed by climate change to the @DeptofDefense supply chain. I’m pleased that the GAO accepted our request."
599,Elizabeth Warren,This morning I sent a letter to the @DHSOIG requesting an investigation into how @DHSgov obtained surveillance data from family separation protests &amp; how DHS officials &amp; law enforcement agencies have used that information. I want answers.
600,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, my friend @AdyBarkan is testifying in the House about why we need #MedicareForAll. He makes a powerful case for why health care is a human right. Read it here: https://t.co/HpOYN1RiO2"
601,Elizabeth Warren,.@Chase: why aren’t customers saving money?Taxpayers: we lost our jobs/homes/savings but gave you a $25b bailoutWorkers: employers don’t pay living wagesEconomists: rising costs + stagnant wages = 0 savingsChase: guess we’ll never knowEveryone: seriously? #MoneyMotivation
602,Elizabeth Warren,"It is not a crime to attend a peaceful rally against this admin’s horrific family separation policy – in fact, I joined thousands of people at the Families Belong Together protest in Boston. The @DHSgov IG should investigate this serious abuse of power."
603,Elizabeth Warren,"Happy to celebrate a big conservation victory: the official designation of the Nashua River system as National Wild &amp; Scenic Rivers. Thank you @RepLoriTrahan &amp; Niki Tsongas for leading this fight to protect the Nashua, Squannacook, &amp; Nissitissit Rivers at the federal level."
604,Elizabeth Warren,"Last year, 69 workers in Massachusetts died on the job. On #WorkersMemorialDay, we honor their memory, and the millions of workers across the country who are hurt or killed at work each year. I’ll keep fighting for protections to ensure every worker is safe on the job."
605,Elizabeth Warren,"The tragedy at the Chabad of Poway synagogue was an attack on the Jewish community — not just in Poway, but everywhere. We will not be divided by hate &amp; fear. An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us."
606,Elizabeth Warren,"70% of adults who misuse prescription opioids get them from friends or family. I passed a bipartisan bill that lets patients partially fill opioid prescriptions. By disposing of unused medication on #TakeBackDay, you can help fight the #OpioidEpidemic. Find a collection site:"
607,Elizabeth Warren,"Today on her birthday, we remember Coretta Scott King, a civil rights hero who dedicated her life to the fight for racial &amp; economic justice. On the floor of the Senate &amp; all across this country, we won't let anyone silence her powerful voice."
608,Elizabeth Warren,Great news for Massachusetts families &amp; terrible news for the @NRA! I’m deeply grateful for @MassAGO Maura Healey’s courageous work to stand up to the gun lobby &amp; keep weapons of war off our streets. MA is a leader in gun safety &amp; the federal govt should follow its example.
609,Elizabeth Warren,My affordable housing bill would help start to close the wealth gap between Black &amp; white families caused by decades of housing discrimination by helping first-time homebuyers in formerly redlined or officially segregated areas.
610,Elizabeth Warren,We cannot ignore the history of housing discrimination in this country &amp; its lasting impact on African American families. I'm very glad that the @TheBACBoston has taken on this powerfully important subject.
611,Elizabeth Warren,I’m very glad that a federal judge blocked @realDonaldTrump's unlawful scheme to attack the #TitleX family planning program. Judge Bastian is right: this administration's rule “creates unreasonable barriers for patients to obtain appropriate medical care.”
612,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ve got a plan that would force housing providers to clean up their act. @RepDebHaaland &amp; I are introducing legislation to increase oversight &amp; transparency, &amp; give military families greater rights to ensure their homes are safe. It's what they deserve."
613,Elizabeth Warren,"Our military families deserve safe, clean housing. But some are living with mice, mold, or lead paint. Why? Because the private companies that build and maintain these homes are padding their own pockets instead of serving military families – and DoD hasn't held them accountable."
614,Elizabeth Warren,This is a big win for coastal communities and our environment – but the Trump Admin never should have pushed to expand offshore drilling to begin with. It’s time for @SecBernhardt to bury this plan once and for all.
615,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ve spent years fighting back against shady for-profit colleges, &amp; the officials &amp; organizations that enable them to defraud students &amp; taxpayers.We should ban for-profit colleges from sucking down federal dollars."
616,Elizabeth Warren,"Too many Americans are being crushed by student debt. Our government should be investing in creating opportunities for people like Alexis and Akilah, not grinding them down even further."
617,Elizabeth Warren,"The first bill I introduced in the Senate was to slash the interest rate on federal student loans to the same deal the big banks got. For years, I’ve been pushing ways to roll back student loan debt because students don't have an army of lobbyists &amp; lawyers."
618,Elizabeth Warren,"The #2020census must count every single person. Our Constitution demands it. Our democracy requires it. By adding an unnecessary citizenship question, @realDonaldTrump and @SecretaryRoss are fanning the flames of hate and bigotry and jeopardizing the Census’ accuracy. It’s wrong."
619,Elizabeth Warren,"Student loan debt was the first fight I picked when I got to the Senate – because if we drown our students in debt, we drown this country’s future."
620,Elizabeth Warren,"Let’s recognize #EarthDay by stating the simple facts:🔬 We believe in science.🏝 We know the climate crisis is happening.🚫 We aren’t doing enough to #ActOnClimate. It's time for big, bold action. It's time for a #GreenNewDeal."
621,Elizabeth Warren,"Long before I ever came within a hundred miles of politics, I was a teacher. I just wanted every kid to get a chance to build something. That’s why I’ve fought so hard to end the student debt crisis &amp; invest in opportunities for America’s young people:"
622,Elizabeth Warren,"Congratulations to @UFCW and the 31,000 @StopandShop workers who are back on the job today after striking to secure fair wages, health and retirement benefits for workers. When we fight together, we win."
623,Elizabeth Warren,"I believe there is God in each and every one of us. I believe the Lord calls on us to act. And that when we do act, the Lord will give us the strength we need. Wishing a Happy Easter to all those celebrating today."
624,Elizabeth Warren,"Space Force won’t increase our competitive advantage in space, or make America any safer. It’s just another layer of military bureaucracy that we’ll have to pour buckets of money into. I think taxpayers deserve better."
625,Elizabeth Warren,"When disaster strikes, everyone should get the help they need. But the evidence shows this isn’t always the case. @BennieGThompson &amp; I want @USGAO to review how disaster aid programs may worsen inequality in our country so we can do something about it."
626,Elizabeth Warren,"My oldest brother was career Air Force, so I know how much servicemembers contribute even after they retire – and that deserves special thanks. I worked to pass a bipartisan resolution designating today as Military Retiree Appreciation Day to recognize their continued service."
627,Elizabeth Warren,"The AG is supposed to serve as the country’s top law enforcement officer – someone who stands up for the rule of law &amp; defends the US Constitution against all enemies, foreign or domestic.William Barr is standing up for only one person: the President of the United States."
628,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump’s cruel immigration policies are filling detention centers, many of which are run by private companies that are raking in taxpayer dollars. Some of the conditions are appalling and there's zero accountability. @ICEgov needs to own up to this and fix it – now."
629,Elizabeth Warren,"The @BostonGlobe is right: “It’s time to create a government-run TurboTax-like service, provide a return-free option for taxpayers, and end the Tax Day rip-off from these companies.” And I’ve got the bill to do it."
630,Elizabeth Warren,Congress passed a bipartisan bill to stop US support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. @realDonaldTrump has just vetoed it. We can’t keep writing the Saudis blank checks. It's time to end our complicity in this humanitarian crisis – I’ll keep on fighting to get it done.
631,Elizabeth Warren,"Title X provides basic health care services like birth control, cancer screenings, &amp; HIV testing for millions of Americans. I’m in this fight to protect &amp; expand Title X funding all the way. #ProtectX"
632,Elizabeth Warren,"Thank YOU for leading this fight, @tressiemcphd! We make each other stronger."
633,Elizabeth Warren,"Dr. @tressiemcphd has spent years studying how for-profit colleges prey on the poor, women, &amp; people of color – sucking down taxpayer dollars &amp; loading up students with debt for useless degrees, while Wall Street rakes in the cash. I just think that’s fundamentally wrong."
634,Elizabeth Warren,"The fact remains: Military student loan borrowers overpaid $100M+ in student loan interest charges because of @usedgov &amp; @DeptofDefense’s lack of communication. Service members &amp; veterans should receive refunds for interest they never owed, but paid anyway."
635,Elizabeth Warren,I successfully included a provision in the 2018 @DeptofDefense budget authorization to automate service members' student loan benefits. I’m very glad DoD proposed an agreement with @usedgov this week to ensure military student loan borrowers receive the benefits they’re owed.
636,Elizabeth Warren,Active duty service members in war zones are supposed to be exempt from paying any interest on their federal student loans. But hundreds – if not thousands – of military borrowers did not see that benefit due to bureaucratic obstacles at @DeptofDefense &amp; @usedgov.
637,Elizabeth Warren,"David Bernhardt should have never been confirmed to lead @Interior with a slew of outstanding ethics complaints. I'm glad the Department's watchdog has now agreed to investigate. Bernhardt's supposed to protect our public lands, not his business"
638,Elizabeth Warren,"Months ago, I called for an investigation into David Bernhardt's work at @Interior to weaken important water and wildlife protections that benefited his former lobbying clients. But the Senate still voted to confirm him last week, despite his blatant conflicts of interest."
639,Elizabeth Warren,"That means if you paid one dollar in taxes on #TaxDay, you paid more than Amazon, Chevron, and Eli Lilly – combined. When giant corporations contribute nothing while hard-working families pay their fair share, that’s a rigged system."
640,Elizabeth Warren,Corporations spent millions of dollars and sent armies of lobbyists to push for the #GOPTaxScam. The result? A tax code so full of loopholes that dozens of giant companies paid nothing on #TaxDay.
641,Elizabeth Warren,"Over the last 60 years, corporations have paid less and less in taxes, while working families foot the bill for critical government services. This #TaxDay, it’s time to ask who this country works for."
642,Elizabeth Warren,"Today we remember the victims of the #BostonMarathon tragedy, &amp; we honor them with a new Boston tradition: #OneBostonDay. It’s a day for random acts of kindness to celebrate Bostonians' strength &amp; the generosity that people showed us from around the world. How will you celebrate?"
643,Elizabeth Warren,"Happy Patriots’ Day, Massachusetts – and good luck to everyone running in the #BostonMarathon! Our Commonwealth &amp; our country are cheering for you today."
644,Elizabeth Warren,"My bill would let millions of Americans simply sign and return a pre-filled tax form, and require the IRS to create a free online tax preparation and filing service – making #TaxDay easier and cheaper for everyone."
645,Elizabeth Warren,"Every year, taxpayers waste too much time and money on tax preparation. And low-income and minority taxpayers are hit the hardest, according to a new report that @SenDuckworth and I requested:"
646,Elizabeth Warren,"Filing your taxes is complicated and expensive. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Congress should pass my Tax Filing Simplification Act, which I’m re-introducing today."
647,Elizabeth Warren,"31k New England @StopandShop workers just went on strike for a contract that provides fair wages, good benefits, &amp; a secure retirement. I stand in solidarity with @UFCW for these hard-working families to be treated with the dignity &amp; respect they deserve."
648,Elizabeth Warren,"I can’t believe it took you 3 hours and 15 minutes to learn Rule #1, @stevenmnuchin1: don’t tell @RepMaxineWaters how to conduct her committee."
649,Elizabeth Warren,"Health care is a basic human right, &amp; we fight for basic human rights. I'm happy to once again co-sponsor #MedicareForAll with @SenSanders."
650,Elizabeth Warren,"Cities like Boston &amp; Framingham are tackling the housing crisis head-on, but the federal govt must do more to help invest in affordable housing &amp; reverse the legacy of housing discrimination. I’m with @marty_walsh &amp; @Mayor_Spicer — let’s do this."
651,Elizabeth Warren,"The American people need to see the FULL report, Mr. Barr."
652,Elizabeth Warren,Wyrick helped grease the skids for Big Oil when he worked for Pruitt back in Oklahoma. And his *very brief* experience on the bench indicates he’ll keep working to roll back key environmental protections. A vote for him is a vote against a clean and safe planet for our kids.
653,Elizabeth Warren,"Remember how former @EPA Secretary Scott Pruitt was forced to resign after umpteen ethics scandals? Well now his protégé, 38-year-old Patrick Wyrick, is on the verge of being confirmed to a lifetime position as a federal judge."
654,Elizabeth Warren,"MA has led the country in protecting &amp; promoting equality, from marriage equality to transgender rights. I’m proud we're leading again by banning the despicable practice of conversion therapy for kids, &amp; I’ll keep fighting for a ban at the federal level."
655,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m calling on the @DeptofDefense to explain the discrepancy. Our troops deserve better than to be used as political pawns. We owe it to them to ensure our military is prepared to meet real challenges, not fake crises of @realDonaldTrump’s own making."
656,Elizabeth Warren,"The mission’s only objective seemed to be using the military for @realDonaldTrump’s political gain. DOD officials claimed the deployment had no impact on our military's readiness or budget. But according to the Marine Corps Commandant, that’s not the case:"
657,Elizabeth Warren,"When @realDonaldTrump sent thousands of troops to our southern border, I questioned the timing (just before the mid-terms), the cost (hundreds of millions of dollars), and the strategy (non-existent)."
658,Elizabeth Warren,The fact that @realDonaldTrump fired the @SecretService director at the same time the Mar-a-Lago news broke raises more concerns about the @WhiteHouse’s handling of security matters. @DHSgov should expand its investigation to include the circumstances of Alles’ firing.
659,Elizabeth Warren,"According to news reports, the March security breach at Mar-a-Lago was more serious than initially reported. But while the @SecretService protects the President’s safety, it’s the @WhiteHouse that ultimately determines who has access to @realDonaldTrump."
660,Elizabeth Warren,"Last week, I requested that the @DHSgov IG review the vetting process used to protect the President from national security threats, &amp; determine if the @WhiteHouse ignored or interfered with @SecretService recommendations."
661,Elizabeth Warren,The Merrimack Valley pipeline explosions could have been completely avoided if @ColumbiaGasMA executives had valued safety over profits. @SenMarkey’s Leonel Rondon Pipeline Safety Act would ensure that cutting corners on safety is a thing of the past.
662,Elizabeth Warren,"Salem’s @MayorDriscoll is fighting hard for affordable housing, but the federal government needs to be a strong partner for mayors like her. I’m grateful for her support of my affordable housing bill."
663,Elizabeth Warren,".@SecNielsen separated mamas from their babies and locked little children in cages.I’m not sorry to see her go. I only wish she’d been fired long ago, before she ever had a chance to resign."
664,Elizabeth Warren,"Student loan companies routinely deceive teachers, first responders, &amp; other public service workers about their eligibility for PSLF. I’m concerned that the @CFPB has abandoned its oversight of these companies, and I want answers."
665,Elizabeth Warren,"Housing costs are a real obstacle to families in MA &amp; across the country, &amp; we can’t fix it by nibbling at the edges. That’s why I’ve got an affordable housing bill to build 3M new housing units, reduce rents by 10%, &amp; create 1.5M jobs. We can do this."
666,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m glad @WellsFargo is starting to buckle under pressure. But given the bank's history of scamming students, they need to do a lot more to prove that they belong on college campuses. Students deserve better."
667,Elizabeth Warren,"UPDATE: After I demanded answers from @WellsFargo about the exorbitant fees they've been charging college students, the bank has finally agreed to stop charging some fees on student debit cards."
668,Elizabeth Warren,"For years, the US has been enabling Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. I was an early co-sponsor of legislation to end our support, which has now passed the House and the Senate. Our complicity must end – @realDonaldTrump must sign this immediately."
669,Elizabeth Warren,"Following troubling reports of security breaches &amp; easy access to @realDonaldTrump at Mar-a-Lago, @RepStephenLynch &amp; I want to know: is the @WhiteHouse doing enough to protect our national security?"
670,Elizabeth Warren,"In 2017, I asked @USGAO to investigate whether @realDonaldTrump has followed protocol for handling secure matters at Mar-a-Lago. GAO reported: while the @SecretService protects the President, it’s the @WhiteHouse that determines who has access to Trump."
671,Elizabeth Warren,"David Bernhardt has spent his career working to pollute our environment for corporate profits. He’s on the side of Big Oil, Big Coal, and Big Ag – not the American people or public lands. When his nomination comes to the Senate floor for a vote, I’ll be voting no. #StopBernhardt"
672,Elizabeth Warren,My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would stop walking conflicts of interest like David Bernhardt from running the same agencies they used to lobby.
673,Elizabeth Warren,That’s not all. A lawsuit alleges that Bernhardt’s ex oil and gas clients “began receiving sudden and dramatic windfalls only months since his swearing-in” as Deputy at @Interior. This is what happens when we let lobbyists waltz through the revolving door.
674,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ve already called for an investigation into David Bernhardt’s actions at @Interior. As Acting Secretary, he worked to weaken important water and wildlife protections – that benefited his old lobbying clients."
675,Elizabeth Warren,The Senate Energy Committee just voted to advance David Bernhardt’s nomination to run @Interior – despite mountains of evidence that he’s more interested in working for swamp monsters like his ex-clients than protecting public lands.
676,Elizabeth Warren,"Wishing my very best to @SenatorBennet as he fights cancer with the same toughness that he fights for Colorado families every day. We’re with you every step of the way, Michael!"
677,Elizabeth Warren,"We’re reintroducing the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act to expand the tools, resources, &amp; services that incarcerated women need to successfully return to their families &amp; communities."
678,Elizabeth Warren,"After we introduced the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act in 2017, the Federal Bureau of Prisons began offering free sanitary products. And last year, many of our provisions were included in the bipartisan prison &amp; sentencing reform bill."
679,Elizabeth Warren,"Since the 1980s, the number of incarcerated women has risen more than 700%. But our federal prison system hasn’t kept up or provided basic support &amp; decent treatment for these women."
680,Elizabeth Warren,"Cadet Nurses just like Betty stepped up to serve our country. Now it's time for Congress to step up and provide them with the honorable discharges, ribbon and medal privileges, and burial privileges they deserve."
681,Elizabeth Warren,"Betty Beecher was one of 120,000 incredible women who served as Cadet Nurses during WWII. Last year, I talked with her about my bipartisan US Cadet Nurse Corps Recognition Act, which I’m re-introducing today."
682,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m also reintroducing the Ending Too Big to Jail Act to hold big bank executives accountable when the banks they lead break the law. If they cheat their customers &amp; crash our economy, Wall Street CEOs should go to jail like everyone else."
683,Elizabeth Warren,"Today I’m introducing the Corporate Executive Accountability Act, which would hold execs of giant corporations criminally responsible when their companies commit crimes, harm large numbers of Americans through civil violations, or repeatedly break the law."
684,Elizabeth Warren,"When big Wall Street banks &amp; giant corporations cheat their customers &amp; break the law, they pay a fine, consider it a cost of doing business, &amp; go back to life as normal. Nothing changes. The system stays rigged for the rich &amp; powerful."
685,Elizabeth Warren,Investing in universal pre-K pays off for our children &amp; our communities. I’m proud of Mayor @marty_walsh for his leadership on early education to give every kid in Boston a fighting chance to succeed.
686,Elizabeth Warren,"Women – ALL women – should be paid the same as men for doing the same work. We'll keep fighting until that happens, and #EqualPayDay becomes obsolete."
687,Elizabeth Warren,"Whether you’re rich or poor, black or white – whether you live in Springfield, Massachusetts or Springfield, Missouri – everyone deserves access to birth control, cancer screenings, and HIV tests. Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights. #TitleX"
688,Elizabeth Warren,I’m grateful that our MA leaders stepped up quickly to address this administration’s reckless threats to #TitleX. But I’ll just be blunt: it is disgraceful that our state has to protect people from harm inflicted by our federal govt.
689,Elizabeth Warren,"Transgender people #WontBeErased by violence, fear, or prejudice. We will fight with you for equality – on #TransDayOfVisibility and every other day."
690,Elizabeth Warren,"Secretary @BetsyDeVosED is blocking 140,000 students who were ripped off by her friends at shady for-profit colleges from getting student loan cancellation they deserve. She’s hurting innocent Americans for no reason – it is heartless."
691,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m glad Tim Sloan got canned, but let’s be clear: if he broke the law, he should go to jail like anyone else. My Ending Too Big to Jail Act would make sure that bank executives can be held personally responsible for their banks’ cheating."
692,Elizabeth Warren,I kept pushing the Fed to maintain the growth cap on @WellsFargo until Tim Sloan was gone. @SenSherrodBrown and I told the @CFPB and @USOCC to use their power to fire him. Because the millions of Americans who got scammed deserve real accountability.
693,Elizabeth Warren,"But @WellsFargo kept getting caught cheating – on mortgages, car loans, money laundering, and loans to service-members (just to name a few). All the while, Tim Sloan kept trying to scam regulators into thinking the bank had reformed. But we weren’t fooled."
694,Elizabeth Warren,"That growth cap gave the Fed leverage to force @WellsFargo to reform – because investors don’t like companies that can't grow. Later, I told Fed Chairman Powell to hold a public vote of the Fed Board before lifting the cap, and he agreed."
695,Elizabeth Warren,"I also pushed Janet Yellen to take more aggressive action. She listened. In her final act as Fed Chair, she capped @WellsFargo's growth until it cleaned up its act and announced board members in charge during the fake accounts scam were leaving too."
696,Elizabeth Warren,"Tim Sloan was supposed to fix @WellsFargo’s problems. But how could he, when he’d been the former CEO John Stump’s right-hand man for years? After the first scandal broke, I told Stumpf his gutless leadership should get him fired. Days later, he was gone."
697,Elizabeth Warren,"Tim Sloan was part of @WellsFargo’s senior leadership during the fake accounts scam – which he got rich off of and tried to cover up. I told him to his face he should have been fired. It took longer than it should have, but he’s finally out as the bank’s CEO."
698,Elizabeth Warren,The last thing we should be doing is giving Saudi Arabia the tools to make a nuclear bomb. That’s why we have a law that requires Congress to review the sale of nuclear technology to foreign govts. But @SecretaryPerry seemed confused by that law – so I helped him understand it.
699,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump is running the most morally bankrupt administration in American history. It's time to restore trust in our government and public officials. Congress could start by passing my Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act, which I reintroduced this week."
700,Elizabeth Warren,Members of @realDonaldTrump’s Mar-a-lago club shouldn’t be able to worm their way into running the VA without any public oversight or accountability.
701,Elizabeth Warren,The government of Saudi Arabia shouldn’t be able to influence public officials by renting out 500 rooms at @realDonaldTrump’s hotel.
702,Elizabeth Warren,"Companies shouldn’t be able to grease the skids by spending money at @realDonaldTrump’s properties. But earlier this month, @TMobile admitted it spent close to $200,000 at Trump’s DC hotel while the Admin considered its $26 billion merger proposal."
703,Elizabeth Warren,But Congress didn't pass the Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act. And @realDonaldTrump didn't divest or disclose. So the country has spent the past 2 years watching his administration stumble from one ethics scandal to another:
704,Elizabeth Warren,"I first introduced the Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act a few weeks before @realDonaldTrump was sworn into office. The legislation would have forced the President, VP, and their families to disclose and divest financial conflicts of interest."
705,Elizabeth Warren,"We don’t know just how vulnerable @realDonaldTrump may be to financial blackmail, or how much he may be profiting off policy decisions. We can't be sure, because he won’t show us his tax returns or get rid of his personal business interests."
706,Elizabeth Warren,"Following the financial crisis, Congress passed my bill to cap pay raises for executives at @FannieMae &amp; @FreddieMac. Instead of enforcing the law, the @FHFA has allowed their executive compensation to increase by millions. This needs to stop now."
707,Elizabeth Warren,"We believe in investing in opportunities for ALL of our kids. No exceptions, @BetsyDeVosED."
708,Elizabeth Warren,"This is what happens when you let a lobbyist waltz through the revolving door &amp; into the @Interior Dept. David Bernhardt is working to protect Big Oil &amp; Big Ag, not our environment. I've already called for an investigation, &amp; I'll vote no on his nomination.https://t.co/vpFJUnAbFx"
709,Elizabeth Warren,The @USGAO also makes it clear that the @CFPB &amp; @FTC need to do their job: hold credit reporting agencies like Equifax accountable and protect consumers from future breaches.
710,Elizabeth Warren,"The @USGAO warned that credit reporting agencies like Equifax pose ""higher risks to consumers"" because of the way they keep &amp; use consumers’ private info. The @FTC needs stronger authority to enforce the law &amp; more tools to crack down on consumer data abuses."
711,Elizabeth Warren,"Days after Equifax announced its massive data breach, @RepCummings &amp; I requested that @USGAO investigate the role &amp; response of federal regulators that are supposed to oversee credit reporting agencies &amp; protect consumers. We just got back GAO’s report."
712,Elizabeth Warren,"Heading to the Senate floor to state a simple scientific fact: climate change is a global crisis, not a political game. Tune in to hear why I support a #GreenNewDeal that will aggressively tackle climate change, economic inequality, and racial injustice."
713,Elizabeth Warren,I’ll say it for the zillionth time: We will not let the Trump administration rip health care away from millions of Americans. Not now. Not ever.
714,Elizabeth Warren,"My friend @SenatorTomUdall fights from the heart every day to strengthen our democracy and build a stronger future – for seniors, for students, for working people, and especially for Native communities. We’ll miss his leadership in the Senate."
715,Elizabeth Warren,"Under CEO Tim Sloan’s watch, @WellsFargo has failed to compensate customers harmed by their illegal auto-lending practices. @SenSherrodBrown &amp; I want the @USOCC, @CFPB, &amp; @federalreserve to tell Sloan it’s time to go."
716,Elizabeth Warren,.@RepStephenLynch is right: @WellsFargo cheated its customers &amp; broke the law. CEO Tim Sloan should be fired – but instead he got a $1 million raise last year. It's obscene. The only way we're ever going to stop these scandals is to hold executives personally accountable.
717,Elizabeth Warren,"Non-compete agreements rig the system against workers. They reduce bargaining power, stifle competition, and hurt workers striving for better opportunities. I'm joining @SenBlumenthal to urge the @FTC to crack down on these harmful contracts."
718,Elizabeth Warren,"When I heard reports that @ActingSecDef Patrick Shanahan may have worked to promote his former employer @Boeing, I took action and investigated. Government officials should work for the people – not big defense"
719,Elizabeth Warren,The Trump administration’s Title X gag rule is an attack on basic health care for millions of women and men. I’m urging @GOPHELP to hold a hearing to discuss the impact of this right-wing ideology disguised as health policy.
720,Elizabeth Warren,Anti-Semitism has no place in Massachusetts or anywhere else in this country. I join with the people of Fall River in condemning this hateful act.
721,Elizabeth Warren,"The @DeptofDefense already has a huge budget – and now it’s using a gimmick to request $165 billion more than the amount allowed by law. It’s time to stop saying yes to more, more, more. We have to make smarter investments in our security and re-invest here at home."
722,Elizabeth Warren,"Last year, I talked to @TheRevAl about my plan to take the first step to address the racial wealth gap and decades of federal government housing discrimination. @RepRichmond &amp; I just reintroduced the American Housing &amp; Economic Mobility Act – it's a big solution to a big problem."
723,Elizabeth Warren,"My Anti-Corruption Act would ban Americans from getting paid to lobby for foreign governments – period. If foreign governments want to express their views, they should use their diplomats."
724,Elizabeth Warren,A majority of Americans agree: the tippy-top 0.1% of the wealthy should pay their fair share so we can start to rebuild America’s middle class.
725,Elizabeth Warren,"Our affordable housing bill has the support of Holyoke Mayor @AlexBMorse &amp; mayors all across Massachusetts &amp; the US. He's right: let's ""put every family on a path toward having a decent home at a decent price and achieving the American dream."""
726,Elizabeth Warren,My heart goes out to our neighbors in East Boston dealing with a terrifying fire this evening. We’re all grateful for our brave @BostonFire firefighters &amp; first responders who put their lives on the line today &amp; every day to keep us safe.
727,Elizabeth Warren,"A few years ago, I got a stack of letters from MA middle schoolers telling me how worried they were about our planet's future. Today, thousands of kids are joining the #YouthClimateStrike. The message is the same: we must fight back against climate change, before it's too late."
728,Elizabeth Warren,"Bigotry and hate have no place in this country or anywhere around the world. We believe that all people have the right to live without fear – no matter who you are, where you’re from, how you pray, or who you love. We will not give an inch on this – not now, not ever."
729,Elizabeth Warren,"Last month, I told @federalreserve Chair Powell that he needs to hear from workers &amp; consumers before approving the @Suntrust &amp; @BBT merger, instead of making a deal behind closed doors. Today, the Fed announced 2 public meetings on the merger. It's a step toward transparency."
730,Elizabeth Warren,"We have real emergencies in this country that our govt needs to address. Gun violence. Climate change. The opioid epidemic. Student debt. The Senate, House &amp; a majority of Americans agree, @realDonaldTrump: your scheme to build a monument to hate at the border isn’t an emergency."
731,Elizabeth Warren,Whether you live in a city or a rural area – whether you’re part of the middle class or struggling to get there – the cost of housing is squeezing people all across this country. @RepRichmond &amp; I have a plan to help fix America’s housing crisis.
732,Elizabeth Warren,"For years, the US has helped Saudi Arabia bomb Yemen. Thousands of civilians have died in airstrikes. Thousands more have starved to death. And America has been complicit. But the Senate just took a step to end our support by passing S.J. Res 7, which I proudly co-sponsored."
733,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m proud to cosponsor the #EqualityAct in the Senate. We believe that equal means equal – and that’s true in marriage, in the workplace, and every other place."
734,Elizabeth Warren,Our Massachusetts mayors know that housing costs are squeezing working families – but they need bold solutions &amp; real investment from the federal government. I’m grateful that 15 mayors from across MA have signed on to support our affordable housing bill. #mapoli
735,Elizabeth Warren,"We're glad to have strong new partners in this fight to make housing more affordable for families &amp; start to tackle the racial wealth gap caused by decades of housing discrimination. @RepRichmond, @RepPressley, @RepRashida &amp; I know that change can’t wait."
736,Elizabeth Warren,"We need big, bold changes to solve our country’s housing crisis. @RepRichmond and I are reintroducing the American Housing &amp; Economic Mobility Act to build 3.2 million new housing units, bring down rent by 10%, and take the first steps to address the racial wealth gap."
737,Elizabeth Warren,"The @USDOL’s new overtime proposal is a slap in the face to millions who would have earned time &amp; a half under @BarackObama’s rule. By only including workers making less than $35k/year &amp; not updating for inflation, America's workers will be left behind."
738,Elizabeth Warren,"Here’s what you need to know about Neomi Rao, @realDonaldTrump’s pick for a lifetime appointment to the DC Circuit Court:❌Repeatedly sided with corporate interests over public good❌Argued against protections for ppl of color❌Dangerously regressive views about sexual assault"
739,Elizabeth Warren,"The @CFPB is supposed to be a tough cop on the beat to protect consumers – but under @MickMulvaneyOMB &amp; @CFPBDirector Kraninger’s watch, the CFPB is only looking out for the crooks. Director Kraninger should either do her job or resign."
740,Elizabeth Warren,"Budgets reflect our values – and this budget doesn’t reflect our values one dime. We believe in opportunity, and that means investing to build a future – not just for some of our kids, but for all of our kids."
741,Elizabeth Warren,But @realDonaldTrump’s budget wouldn’t cut everything. There’s one place this budget is out of control: More ships. More jets. More nuclear weapons. And more money for his monument to hate and division.
742,Elizabeth Warren,And @realDonaldTrump’s budget doesn’t just hurt the elderly. Here’s the $220 billion he proposes in cuts to SNAP – food stamps for families to put food on the table. Food so children don’t have to go to bed hungry.
743,Elizabeth Warren,"In the middle of a housing crisis, this is where @realDonaldTrump’s budget would gut @HUDgov. Huge cuts on housing for the elderly, huge cuts on housing for people with AIDS, and huge cuts for affordable housing. If Grandma doesn’t get a job, then sorry, Grandma."
744,Elizabeth Warren,"Right here? This is @realDonaldTrump budget-speak for slashing Medicaid by billions of dollars. Basically the federal government would tell our most vulnerable Americans: “Sorry, you’re on your own.”"
745,Elizabeth Warren,"And see this? This is where @realDonaldTrump’s budget would completely wipe out community block grants – money that cities &amp; towns in MA &amp; across the country use for afterschool programs, public safety, legal aid, affordable housing, &amp; other essential services. They’re gone."
746,Elizabeth Warren,"See this? This is where @realDonaldTrump’s budget would eliminate the Public Student Loan Forgiveness program – the program that helps America’s public school teachers, nurses, police officers, &amp; other public servants with their student loan debt. Poof, gone."
747,Elizabeth Warren,"A budget is about more than numbers – a budget is about values. And the budget @realDonaldTrump released today is another big wet kiss to the super-rich &amp; giant corporations, and it guts programs for everyone else."
748,Elizabeth Warren,.@RepPressley hit the nail on the head. Crippling student loan debt is a crisis affecting millions of American families. You’d think the head of an agency responsible for protecting students from abusive lenders would at least be able to acknowledge that fact.
749,Elizabeth Warren,The #ForThePeople Act is a strong first step toward cleaning up Washington corruption. I’m fighting to get this bill a vote on the Senate floor – and I’ll keep fighting for my Anti-Corruption Act for more big structural changes to #EndCorruptionNow &amp; strengthen our democracy.
750,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m very grateful that we have a strong partner in the House to lead these big fights to #EndCorruptionNow – and win them. @RepJayapal works her heart out every day to make this government work #ForThePeople, not the wealthy &amp; well-connected."
751,Elizabeth Warren,One more thing: We shouldn’t have to beg candidates to let people see their financial interests. @RepJayapal led the charge to require presidential candidates to release years of tax returns for themselves AND their business empires. #EndCorruptionNow #ForThePeople
752,Elizabeth Warren,"In case you haven’t noticed, a zillion Trump officials have had to lawyer up for breaking the rules. The House passed our plan to make sure that government officials who establish legal expense funds can’t secretly beg powerful interests for money. #EndCorruptionNow #ForThePeople"
753,Elizabeth Warren,"The House passed our provision to require ALL White House staff &amp; advisors, paid or unpaid, to follow basic ethics rules. That includes, for example, senior advisor family members who don't divest their holdings &amp; hand out WH visits to investors. #EndCorruptionNow #ForThePeople"
754,Elizabeth Warren,No more selling out to foreign governments that abuse human rights &amp; undermine our national security. @RepJayapal made sure the House bill included our ban on Washington lobbyists from getting paid big bucks to lobby for foreign governments. #EndCorruptionNow #ForThePeople
755,Elizabeth Warren,"Incoming administrations should work for the people, not lobbyists &amp; industry insiders. The House passed our plan to force people who work on presidential transition teams to follow ethics rules like every other official. #EndCorruptionNow #ForThePeople"
756,Elizabeth Warren,".@RepJayapal &amp; I have the most ambitious anti-corruption legislation since Watergate to #EndCorruptionNow. This week, we got terrific news: with @RepJayapal's hard work &amp; persistence, the House included — &amp; passed — some key parts of it in the historic #ForThePeople Act:"
757,Elizabeth Warren,People all across this country are being crushed by student loan debt. That’s why I’m so glad @EricLesser is leading the fight to help student borrowers in Massachusetts.
758,Elizabeth Warren,Bill Shine’s resignation removes 1 ethics problem at the most ethically bankrupt @WhiteHouse in history. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would prevent White House staffers from getting paid off by their ex-employers when they're supposed to be working for the American people.
759,Elizabeth Warren,To all the women who have been told “no” over and over again and continue to persist: keep it up. You make us stronger. #InternationalWomensDay
760,Elizabeth Warren,"Some military families have been living in toxic homes while the private companies that oversee them make a guaranteed profit. I’m working on a new bill to fix that broken system. In the meantime, @DeptofDefense needs to start enforcing the rules that are already on the books."
761,Elizabeth Warren,Are they joking? @Equifax didn’t take data security seriously because it had no financial incentive to do so. That’s why we need my bill with @MarkWarner to impose automatic fines for data breaches at companies like Equifax &amp; stop this from happening
762,Elizabeth Warren,"The average student in Massachusetts graduates with $32,065 in student loans. Instead of jump-starting their lives and careers, they’re being weighed down by debt. I’m co-sponsoring @SenBrianSchatz’s #DebtFreeCollege bill to make sure every student can build an economic future."
763,Elizabeth Warren,"DHS @SecNielsen testified today that @CBP “never purposely put a child in a cage."" False.I went to the processing center in McAllen, TX. I saw cages of people with my own eyes. Men, women, and children treated like animals. We must hold the Trump Admin accountable."
764,Elizabeth Warren,Chad Readler led efforts to let giant insurance companies discriminate against Americans with pre-existing conditions. A vote to confirm him as a federal appeals court judge is a stamp of approval to rip health care away from millions of Americans.
765,Elizabeth Warren,"The internet doesn’t belong to a few giant companies – it belongs to all of us. Rather than tilting the playing field toward corporate interests, I'm joining @SenMarkey and @SenateDems to introduce a bill that restores #NetNeutrality and keeps the internet free and open for all."
766,Elizabeth Warren,Climate change is a threat to our national security. Full stop.
767,Elizabeth Warren,"My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would require most @WhiteHouse employees (including Bill Shine) to recuse themselves from all issues that might financially benefit a former employer or client. Our government should work for everyone, not just @realDonaldTrump's inner circle."
768,Elizabeth Warren,"It's no wonder @FoxNews is an echo chamber for the Trump Admin's fear-mongering. Trump's Deputy Chief of Staff is still cashing checks from Fox, his ex employer. My office requested info on Bill Shine's possible ethics violations in December. Still"
769,Elizabeth Warren,The American people deserve better than an administration that appears to be for sale to companies eager to line the President’s pockets.
770,Elizabeth Warren,"T-Mobile CEO @JohnLegere publicly insulted @realDonaldTrump about poor service at his hotels. But now that @TMobile has a $26 billion merger with @Sprint pending Trump Admin approval, he's happy to spend $195,000 at Trump’s DC hotel. Sound shady? It is."
771,Elizabeth Warren,"The @DeptofDefense runs the largest employer-sponsored child care program in the country, caring for over 200,000 kids. It’s the kind of high-quality, affordable child care that should be in every family’s reach – and it’s the model for my #UniversalChildCare plan."
772,Elizabeth Warren,"Massachusetts has lost one of its greatest champions with the passing of Rob Restuccia. His legacy will live on in our fight to guarantee health care to every American. My heart goes out to his friends, family, and everyone at @HealthPolicyHub."
773,Elizabeth Warren,It's wrong for states to punish people struggling to pay off student loans by taking away their drivers or professional licenses. That's why @SenRubioPress and I reintroduced legislation to allow borrowers to keep working and build better financial
774,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m proud to serve with (and be a part of) a record-breaking number of women in the 116th Congress. As we kick off #WomensHistoryMonth, it’s a reminder of how far we’ve come, and how far we still have left to go."
775,Elizabeth Warren,"The opioid epidemic is a public health crisis – we have to treat it like one. Some towns are making real progress with state and federal grants, but they need more resources. My plan, the #CAREact, would spend $100B on treatment, recovery, and research."
776,Elizabeth Warren,"Jane Bolin, the first Black woman in US history to become a judge, said that achieving equality for Black women means fighting ""every inch of the way.” As the struggle for equality continues, we follow her courageous example. #BlackHistoryMonth"
777,Elizabeth Warren,I didn't think things could get any worse at the @EPA after Scott Pruitt. But I was wrong. The Senate just confirmed Andrew Wheeler – an ex-lobbyist who worked to roll back critical environmental regulations – to run the agency. Our kids will pay the
778,Elizabeth Warren,"As Acting @Interior Secretary, David Bernhardt is supposed to protect America’s public lands. Instead, the ex-lobbyist appears to be protecting the interests of his former clients. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would keep him out of the Dept."
779,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s time to legalize marijuana, and stand against an unjust criminal justice system. I’m proud to co-sponsor the Marijuana Justice Act."
780,Elizabeth Warren,"My friend @PattyMurray has spent decades fighting for our youngest kids. That’s why I’m proud to stand with her in the fight for quality, affordable child care and preschool for America’s children."
781,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s the @federalreserve's job to vet mergers like the one between @Suntrust and @BBT that would create another Too Big To Fail Bank. But in the last decade the Fed hasn’t denied a single application. Today, I told Chairman Powell why that has to change:"
782,Elizabeth Warren,"Bayard Rustin was a leading organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. Openly gay, he never achieved the widespread recognition he deserved. Listen to him explain why he fought so hard for the rights of marginalized communities. #BlackHistoryMonth"
783,Elizabeth Warren,Our servicemembers &amp; their families shouldn't have to live in toxic homes while the private companies that oversee them make a guaranteed profit. Military families sacrifice for our country every day. We owe it to them to protect their health &amp; well-being.
784,Elizabeth Warren,Republican politicians just tried (and failed) again to score political points at the expense of women. Enough. Women and their doctors should decide what’s best for their health – not the @SenateGOP.
785,Elizabeth Warren,"Eric Miller has spent his career working to gut tribal sovereignty, but Trump nominated him to sit on the appeals court with jurisdiction over 75% of federally recognized tribes. Confirming him would threaten tribal rights – so I'll be voting no today."
786,Elizabeth Warren,"Dr. @maejemison is many things – a physician, an engineer, a dancer, an astronaut, and the first African-American woman in space. Now, she’s working to help the next generation of explorers by getting more women and girls into STEM."
787,Elizabeth Warren,"Another week, another @WellsFargo scandal under Tim Sloan's leadership. The @FederalReserve shouldn't remove the bank's growth cap until Sloan is"
788,Elizabeth Warren,"Massachusetts families pay an eye-popping $20,000 a year for infant child care – that’s more than in-state college tuition. My plan for #UniversalChildCare would make child care free for tens of thousands of MA families, &amp; millions more across the country."
789,Elizabeth Warren,"Saudi Arabia brutally murdered a journalist in its own consulate and bombed Yemeni civilians with US-armed warplanes. And if that wasn’t bad enough, it also may have transferred US weapons to violent extremists.It's time to start holding Saudi Arabia accountable."
790,Elizabeth Warren,"Communities are working hard to fight the #OpioidEpidemic, but they can’t do it alone. My bill with @RepCummings, the #CAREact, would provide $100 billion in federal funding for treatment and research."

792,Elizabeth Warren,"Trump's wall is a #FakeNationalEmergency – but natural disasters like hurricanes, wildfires, and floods are real. My bill would prevent @realDonaldTrump from diverting disaster recovery funds to pay for his border wall."
793,Elizabeth Warren,"Whether you have kids, grandkids, or no kids at all – America's children are our country's future. That means we have an interest, and a responsibility, to invest in them. Let’s start by making #UniversalChildCare a reality."
794,Elizabeth Warren,"My #UltraMillionaireTax on America’s wealthiest families could fund #UniversalChildCare, giving millions of kids a leg up. And by offering parents more options to balance work and family, we could also help boost our economy."
795,Elizabeth Warren,"In many states, child care is more expensive than in-state college tuition. Under my plan for #UniversalChildCare, child care would be free for nearly 9 million kids. And no family would pay more than 7% of their income for child care."
796,Elizabeth Warren,"My plan for #UniversalChildCare would build off the success of Head Start to create a network of high-quality child care options. Federal funding would guarantee every family has access to high-quality, affordable care for kids from birth to kindergarten."
797,Elizabeth Warren,"When my kids were little, I struggled to find good, reliable, and affordable child care. It felt like an impossible task then – and it still is for many families. That’s why I’m proposing a new plan for #UniversalChildCare."
798,Elizabeth Warren,"On this #PresidentsDay, celebrating the groundbreaking achievements of this man, who is living proof that no dream is too big."
799,Elizabeth Warren,"Our military families deserve safe, clean housing. So why are some living with mice, mold, or lead paint? Because the private companies that maintain many of their homes are skimping, but still padding their pockets with profits. It’s unacceptable."
800,Elizabeth Warren,"Mexico wouldn't pay for @realDonaldTrump's wall. Congress wouldn't fully fund it. So now he's throwing a temper tantrum and declaring a ""national emergency."" My new bill would stop him from using disaster recovery funds for his pet project."
801,Elizabeth Warren,"A year after the Parkland Shooting, Congress still hasn’t passed strong legislation to address gun violence. But I’m going to keep fighting – along with the MSD survivors and students across the country who are working to #EndGunViolence. Together, we will make change."
802,Elizabeth Warren,"Thousands of US citizens in Puerto Rico died during Hurricane Maria and its aftermath. Brock Long oversaw the Trump Administration's botched disaster response, and he has enabled the Administration's negligence regarding Puerto Rico. His resignation was long overdue."
803,Elizabeth Warren,"The House just voted to end US military support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. I’m proud to be an early co-sponsor of the companion bill in the Senate, and I urge @SenateMajLdr McConnell to bring it to a vote. We cannot continue to be complicit in the deaths of civilians."
804,Elizabeth Warren,My plan to #EndCorruptionNow in 6 steps:✅Padlock the revolving door✅Force federal candidates to disclose their tax returns✅End lobbying as we know it✅Stop corporate capture of rule-making✅Make our courts more open &amp; transparent✅Hire a new sheriff to police corruption
805,Elizabeth Warren,You bet I do.
806,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump wants 2 things from his Attorney General: loyalty to Trump, and a willingness to put the interests of the powerful few ahead of everyone else.William Barr checks both those boxes. And that’s exactly why I’ll be voting no."
807,Elizabeth Warren,Mary Hamilton successfully fought a court system that denied Black Americans the dignity of being called Mr. or Miss. Her heroic actions advanced equality for all Americans. #BlackHistoryMonth
808,Elizabeth Warren,It’s too easy for the wealthy &amp; well-connected to rig the system during presidential transitions. I have a bill with @SenatorCarper &amp; @RepCummings to ensure transition teams operate for the American people—not special interests.
809,Elizabeth Warren,A bank teller who takes a few 20s from the bank is looking at serious jail time. But the @WellsFargo CEO can cheat millions of Americans and walk away. That’s a rigged system - and it needs to change.
810,Elizabeth Warren,Ready.
811,Elizabeth Warren,"Gigantic banks wrecked our economy, but the Fed told me they are rubber-stamping nearly every proposed bank merger. @SunTrust and @BBT are probably next. We can’t let banks become too big to fail again: American families will suffer."
812,Elizabeth Warren,"My heart goes out to @RepDebDingell, and their entire family."
813,Elizabeth Warren,Kathy Kraninger gutted the @CFPB rule that would stop payday lenders from trapping borrowers in cycles of debt. Siding with payday lenders over consumers is shameful - Kraninger needs to withdraw this proposal immediately.
814,Elizabeth Warren,"If we want to live in a world with clean air and water, we have to take real action to combat climate change now. I'm proud to join @RepAOC and @SenMarkey on a #GreenNewDeal resolution to fight for our planet and our kids’ futures."
815,Elizabeth Warren,"We have data to determine if Saudi jets killed Yemeni civilians with our support. We need to face the ugly truth - by continuing to enable Saudi Arabia, America is complicit in the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. We must end our support for this war now."
816,Elizabeth Warren,"When I asked the Pentagon last year if they tracked US fuel &amp; bombs used in Saudi airstrikes that killed civilians in Yemen, they said no. This time, the Pentagon admitted there’s an entire database of that info and @DeptofDefense has access to it."
817,Elizabeth Warren,"Ahead of @realDonaldTrump's #SOTU speech, let's list some things we could work together on instead of building a wall. Here's a start:-Build an economy &amp; democracy that works for everyone-Ensure access to affordable, quality health care &amp; education-End corruption in Washington"
818,Elizabeth Warren,Sajid Shahriar is my guest for tonight's #SOTU. He's a federal worker and @AFGENational rep who was affected by the shutdown. He wants to make sure we avoid another one and keep our government open.
819,Elizabeth Warren,David Bernhardt is an ex-Big Oil lobbyist who's worked to pollute our environment for profit. He’s a walking conflict of interest who shouldn’t even be allowed through the front door of the @Interior Dept. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would keep him out.
820,Elizabeth Warren,Glad to announce Sajid Shahriar will be my #SOTU guest. He's a MA federal worker and union leader who went 35 days without a paycheck during the #TrumpShutdown. Government workers like Sajid shouldn't be used as bargaining chips. They deserve better.
821,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s long past time to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. And when they return, we need to make sure they get the health care, GI benefits, and other support they've earned."
822,Elizabeth Warren,"We won this fight, but we know @BetsyDeVosED and her cronies at @usedgov aren’t looking out for students. We’ve got to stay watchful and keep her accountable. Follow our oversight work at #DeVosWatch."
823,Elizabeth Warren,"A piece of good news for students, teachers, and student loan borrowers. This week, I called out @realDonaldTrump for abruptly replacing the top government watchdog in charge of holding @BetsyDeVosEd accountable. Now the Trump Admin has back-tracked:"
824,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump wants to upgrade our nuclear arsenal AND end decades-old arms control agreements. That's a recipe for disaster. Congress must immediately pass my #NoFirstUse bill to prevent him (or any president) from unilaterally starting a nuclear war.
825,Elizabeth Warren,We can hold Russia accountable without tearing up the INF Treaty. Withdrawing won't make America any safer – it just increases the potential for a new arms race that would make the world even more dangerous.
826,Elizabeth Warren,"Coretta Scott King was a powerful civil rights leader, an early supporter of the LGBTQ community, a passionate opponent of apartheid, and a forceful advocate for peace. A strong voice who refused to be silenced. #BlackHistoryMonth"
827,Elizabeth Warren,"Today marks the beginning of #BlackHistoryMonth, a time to lift up and celebrate the contributions of the millions of Black Americans who have fought to ensure our country lives up to its highest values."
828,Elizabeth Warren,"Hundreds of thousands of federal contract workers – security guards, cafeteria workers, janitors, and more – missed paychecks during the #TrumpShutdown.I’m with @SenTinaSmith and @RepPressley. We need to make sure they get the back pay they deserve. #BackPayNow"
829,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ll keep fighting for a world without nuclear weapons. In the meantime, we must take real steps to reduce the likelihood of nuclear conflict. No President – Republican or Democrat – should be able to unilaterally start a nuclear"
830,Elizabeth Warren,"The only purpose of the US nuclear arsenal should be deterrence. Retaining the right to use nuclear weapons first won’t make Americans safer. In fact, in increases the possibility of a dangerous miscalculation &amp; puts us – &amp; everyone else – at greater risk of nuclear devastation."
831,Elizabeth Warren,Here’s my entire bill on #NoFirstUse:
832,Elizabeth Warren,"We should never be the first to use a nuclear weapon in a conflict. I'm proud to join with @RepAdamSmith, Chairman of @HASCDemocrats, to introduce a bill that formalizes what most Americans already believe: the United States should never initiate a nuclear war. #NoFirstUse"
833,Elizabeth Warren,"10 years ago today, President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law. It was an important step, but far too many women – especially women of color – still don't receive #EqualPay for equal work. We've got to keep fighting."
834,Elizabeth Warren,"The ultra-rich keep getting richer while 40% of Americans can’t come up with $400 in an emergency. That’s not a sustainable economy, or a sustainable democracy. My #UltraMillionaireTax makes the richest 0.1% pay more – and allows us to invest in opportunities for everyone."
835,Elizabeth Warren,Today I met with federal workers in Boston. They're glad to be back on the job (and getting paid) – but also deeply worried about whether or not the government will go into another shutdown.Federal workers shouldn't be used as pawns in the GOP's political games.
836,Elizabeth Warren,I could go on but I don't need to: it’s clear that Tim Sloan isn't the right person to try to clean up @WellsFargo. His hands are too dirty from overseeing years of scams and scandals. That’s not just an “informed” opinion. That’s a fact.
837,Elizabeth Warren,"Of course, we can’t forget the most recent @WellsFargo scandal that took place right under Tim Sloan’s nose. The bank has been gouging students with triple the fees of its competitors on college campuses."
838,Elizabeth Warren,.@WellsFargo also agreed to pay $175 million to settle claims that it charged Black and Latino borrowers higher fees and rates on mortgages than white borrowers with similar credit profiles.
839,Elizabeth Warren,Then there are the 500+ customers who lost their homes because of a “calculation error” by @WellsFargo. And what did Tim Sloan do to make it right? Sent the families affected some inadequate checks.
840,Elizabeth Warren,"Speaking of auto loans, that reminds me of the time @WellsFargo didn't provide refunds to tens of thousands of people who paid off their car loans early. What a great way to treat loyal customers!"
841,Elizabeth Warren,Fake accounts were just one of the scandals that went down at @WellsFargo while Tim Sloan was part of the bank’s top leadership. There are a lot to choose from. Like when they charged hundreds of thousands of customers for auto insurance they didn’t need.
842,Elizabeth Warren,"Remember the fake accounts scam that got @WellsFargo in trouble to begin with? As CFO and COO, Tim Sloan helped enable it. He got rich off it. And he tried to cover it up. How's he the right guy to clean up the mess?"
843,Elizabeth Warren,"Tim Sloan doesn't think I have an ""informed"" opinion about how he's helped lead @WellsFargo. But I’ve actually been paying pretty close attention, and I’ve got a long list of reasons why I think he should be fired. (Get comfortable, this is gonna take a while.)"
844,Elizabeth Warren,"It's time to fundamentally transform our tax code so it’s not rigged for the rich. My plan taxes the wealth of the 75,000 US households with a net worth over $50 million.Let’s demand the top 0.1% pay their fair share – &amp; start rebuilding our middle"
845,Elizabeth Warren,"Federal workers standing in food lines. Medical care put off. Credit ruined. Contractors who aren’t guaranteed back pay. So much suffering caused by the #TrumpShutdown, and for what? It's time to get our government back on track and working for the American people again."
846,Elizabeth Warren,"Over a month ago, the Senate voted unanimously on a compromise to keep the gov't open. Trump refused to sign it. Republicans just voted down a new measure – so the #TrumpShutdown continues.How much longer do @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SenateGOP plan on holding federal workers hostage?"
847,Elizabeth Warren,Wall Street fat cat Wilbur Ross is a millionaire many times over – so he can't seem to comprehend why missing a paycheck or two would devastate so many families. Newsflash @SecretaryRoss: Federal employees are hurting. Tell your boss to end the #TrumpShutdown.
848,Elizabeth Warren,"Mayors across the country agree: we need more affordable housing. My plan, the American Housing &amp; Economic Mobility Act, would help create 3.2 million new homes and 1.5 million jobs, and bring down rents by 10% – all without adding a dime to the"
849,Elizabeth Warren,"Hey, Massachusetts: Have you signed up for your 2019 health insurance yet? Today is your last chance to #GetCovered! Go to https://t.co/SdkzQJyQAW and find a plan that works for you and your family."
850,Elizabeth Warren,"Yesterday, I joined hundreds of @32BJSEIU workers at Boston Logan Airport. They're fighting back against wage theft and standing up for TSA agents and air traffic controllers who are working without pay during the #TrumpShutdown. People deserve to be paid for the work they do."
851,Elizabeth Warren,The Trump Administration has reportedly been trying to withhold funding for disaster recovery efforts in Puerto Rico and other states and territories.These are US citizens. They deserve answers – not
852,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again – the only thing that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether or not they can handle the job. Banning people from serving based on gender identity isn’t only shameful – it makes America less safe."
853,Elizabeth Warren,"As we celebrate Dr. King's legacy, we must remember: ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly."""
854,Elizabeth Warren,"It can be hard to keep fighting. It requires every ounce of strength we have. But these are righteous fights, and as we work together for the good, we do not tire, we don't get distracted, and we don't lose heart. We keep going."
855,Elizabeth Warren,"Omaha elder and Vietnam War veteran Nathan Phillips endured hateful taunts with dignity and strength, then urged us all to do better. Listen to his words:"
856,Elizabeth Warren,Federal workers are not bargaining chips. @realDonaldTrump and @SenateMajLdr McConnell must end this shutdown and re-open the government immediately.
857,Elizabeth Warren,"Don and the Massachusetts Military Support Foundation have been helping US Coast Guard families make ends meet by distributing thousands of pounds of food since the #TrumpShutdown began. The longer Republicans drag out this shutdown, the more hard-working families will suffer."
858,Elizabeth Warren,Wells Fargo has a record of cheating its customers. The latest victim? College students. A new @CFPB report shows the bank gouged students with triple the fees of its competitors. @WellsFargo doesn’t belong on college campuses.
859,Elizabeth Warren,"We already knew that the Trump Administration ripped apart thousands of families – but a new report shows the real number is much, much higher. Separating even one child from their family is cruel and immoral. #FamiliesBelongTogether."
860,Elizabeth Warren,"The House has already passed legislation to end the #TrumpShutdown, and the Senate could vote to send it to the President’s desk today. Instead, we're voting on a bill to further restrict reproductive rights. Time to get your priorities straight, @SenateMajLdr."
861,Elizabeth Warren,"A record 131 women will serve in the 116th Congress – this is what change looks like.Proud to be in the fight for Massachusetts families alongside my friends, @RepPressley, @RepLoriTrahan, and @RepKClark."
862,Elizabeth Warren,"8,200 federal workers in MA – including members of the Coast Guard, TSA agents, air traffic controllers, health care providers, &amp; parks staff – have been sent home or are working without pay.Republicans must stop playing politics with people's lives &amp; end the #TrumpShutdown."
863,Elizabeth Warren,"Puerto Rico receives far less Medicaid funding than states, hurting fellow US citizens. I've offered legislation to provide Medicaid parity to PR &amp; other US territories, &amp; called for hearings on the challenges facing PR's health system. This can't wait."
864,Elizabeth Warren,"William Barr has already expressed his bias against the Mueller investigation – that alone should disqualify him from serving as Attorney General. He also wants to gut the ACA, thinks Roe v Wade should be overturned, &amp; has a troubling record on criminal justice. I'll vote no."
865,Elizabeth Warren,"Giant companies may hate my Affordable Drug Manufacturing bill - but I don’t work for them. The American people deserve competitive markets and fair prices. By fixing the broken generic drug market, we can bring the cost of prescriptions"
866,Elizabeth Warren,"24 days into the #TrumpShutdown and over 800,000 federal employees have already missed 1 paycheck. How many more before Republicans stop crushing working families and re-open the government? Time to end this."
867,Elizabeth Warren,"Up to 85,000 seniors, disabled Americans, and low income families are already at risk of losing their homes because of the #TrumpShutdown. That’s just plain cruel – it’s time for Republicans to stop playing politics and re-open the government."
868,Elizabeth Warren,"Members of the US Coast Guard and other federal employees should be cashing their paychecks today. But thanks to the #TrumpShutdown, some will be visiting local food banks instead. This cannot continue – Republicans must re-open the government."
869,Elizabeth Warren,"Mexico won't pay for @realDonaldTrump's stupid wall, and neither will Congress. So now, he's considering using dollars that were supposed to go to disaster recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, TX, CA &amp; elsewhere to fund his political stunt. Unacceptable."
870,Elizabeth Warren,"Andrew Wheeler – a former lobbyist who spent his career helping Big Coal poison our environment – has been officially nominated to run the @EPA. Under my plan to #EndCorruptionNow, he wouldn't be allowed to get anywhere near that agency – much less run it."
871,Elizabeth Warren,"The #TrumpShutdown is hurting people in MA &amp; across America, &amp; Native communities are some of the hardest hit. The House already passed a bill to re-open the gov't, including @IHSgov &amp; other crucial agencies. @SenateGOP should pass it &amp; end the shutdown."
872,Elizabeth Warren,No college student should go hungry while they work towards a better future. That’s why I worked with @BHCCBoston President @PamEddinger and my Senate colleagues to request the first ever federal report on food insecurity on college campuses:
873,Elizabeth Warren,"Building a border wall won’t make us any safer. You know what will? Ending this ridiculous #TrumpShutdown and making sure vital agencies like the US Coast Guard, TSA, and federal law enforcement have the funds they need to maintain our national security."
874,Elizabeth Warren,American workers have helped create record corporate profits – but their wages have stayed flat for decades as companies reward CEOs and wealthy shareholders instead. My Accountable Capitalism Act would give workers a real voice in corporate decisions.
875,Elizabeth Warren,"Lockouts are unsafe, unfair, and harmful to hard-working families. @SenMarkey and I are grateful that after difficult negotiations, the 6-month lockout by @NationalGridUS is finally over, and 1,250 @SteelWorkers workers will soon be back on the job."
876,Elizabeth Warren,The House has already passed bipartisan bills to end the #TrumpShutdown. I agree with @ChrisVanHollen. The Senate’s first and only order of business right now should be passing that same legislation. We need to re-open the government and get our federal employees back to work.
877,Elizabeth Warren,"Rent and mortgage payments missed. Bills overdue. Savings dipped into. Hundreds of thousands of American families are hurting, and the longer the government is shut down, the worse it gets. It's time to end the #TrumpShutdown."
878,Elizabeth Warren,Corruption eats away at the heart of democracy. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow will make sure government represents the people – not just the wealthy and well-connected.
879,Elizabeth Warren,"Residents in the Merrimack Valley need answers about the September 13th #MVGasFires, not more delays. We need to end the #TrumpShutdown now and stop hurting hard-working families."
880,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, I was sworn-in for my second term in the United States Senate. It’s been my honor to represent the Commonwealth, and I plan to keep on fighting for a government that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and the well-connected."
881,Elizabeth Warren,"Over 7,000 people in Massachusetts have been sent home or are working without pay during the #TrumpShutdown. Until @realDonaldTrump re-opens the government, I'm donating my salary to @HIASrefugees, a nonprofit that helps refugees and makes our country stronger in the process."
882,Elizabeth Warren,"John Stumpf eventually lost his job as Wells Fargo’s CEO. But far too often, politicians run our government for the rich and powerful instead of holding them accountable. It's time to end Washington corruption and start building a government that works for all working people."
883,Elizabeth Warren,"It's been over a week since a vital federal program supporting victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, &amp; stalking expired. @realDonaldTrump must end his shutdown &amp; work with Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act as soon as possible."
884,Elizabeth Warren,So many of these #ShutdownStories are truly heartbreaking. The #TrumpShutdown isn't some political game. It's hurting hard-working Americans. @realDonaldTrump must end it now.
885,Elizabeth Warren,"Our government is supposed to work for working families. Instead: 🛑25% of the federal government shut down.🛑380,000 workers sent home.🛑420,000 federal employees working without pay.Stop playing politics with people's lives, @realDonaldTrump. End the shutdown."
886,Elizabeth Warren,It's time for the Pentagon to come clean. The American people deserve to know the full scope of our operations assisting Saudi Arabia in Yemen. We need to hold our partners – and ourselves – accountable.
887,Elizabeth Warren,"When I asked the Pentagon if they tracked US fuel and bombs used in Saudi airstrikes in Yemen, they said no. But new reports show that information was available to us all along. The reality is, US supported airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians."
888,Elizabeth Warren,The Senate voted unanimously on a compromise to keep the government open. @realDonaldTrump chose to reject it and go into another #TrumpShutdown.  The American people deserve better. They deserve a government that works for them.
889,Elizabeth Warren,"Felipe Alonzo-Gomez was just 8 years old when he died on Christmas Eve while in CBP custody. CBP must provide answers about how this happened, and create stronger protections for people in its custody. The loss of even one child is too great – these tragedies cannot continue."
890,Elizabeth Warren,"This Christmas Eve, Bonita Williams should be wrapping gifts for her grandkids. Instead, she's worrying about how she'll pay her electric bill. The #TrumpShutdown is hurting hard-working Americans. @realDonaldTrump must end it."
891,Elizabeth Warren,"The Violence Against Women Act – which supports critical programs to help victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, and stalking – expired at midnight. We could have funded it, but @realDonaldTrump would rather shut down the government for a wall that doesn’t make us any safer."
892,Elizabeth Warren,"This shutdown was completely avoidable. Now, hundreds of thousands of federal employees will go without a paycheck over the holidays as @realDonaldTrump throws another temper tantrum over his stupid wall. Republicans’ latest attempt to divide and distract us."
893,Elizabeth Warren,"The @DeptVetAffairs should be serving America's veterans, not helping @realDonaldTrump's Mar-a-Lago cronies line their pockets. It's time for the @VetAffairsOIG to finally investigate this corruption."
894,Elizabeth Warren,.@USCCRgov just issued a major new report about how the federal government is failing to meet its obligations to Native communities. We must take action. Congress could start by passing my housing bill to help end the shortage of housing in Indian Country.
895,Elizabeth Warren,Ethics officials at the Justice Dept recommended that Acting AG Whitaker recuse himself from the Mueller investigation – but he doesn't have to listen to them. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would create an independent ethics office to force federal officials to do what's right.
896,Elizabeth Warren,"We can’t trust Big Pharma to bring down prices on their own. That’s why I introduced legislation this week to make prescription drugs cheaper, and have a plan to bring down monthly costs for families."
897,Elizabeth Warren,"Today’s news that Big Pharma will be jacking up prices – again – is outrageous. Drug companies promised to tackle rising drug costs, but now we see what their “promises” are worth. We need action to stop Big Pharma from gouging American"
898,Elizabeth Warren,A young man was killed and thousands in the Merrimack Valley were stranded without heat or power for months – all because @ColumbiaGasMA and @NiSourceInc utterly failed to prioritize customers’ safety. @SenMarkey and I are demanding accountability:
899,Elizabeth Warren,"The rules are rigged. The wealthy and well-connected want to distract us from demanding change by pitting black, white, and brown working people against each other. But we see through it, and we're ready to fight for a better future."
900,Elizabeth Warren,Pharmaceutical companies shouldn’t get to jack up prices on generic drugs whenever they feel like it. That's why I’m calling for Congressional hearings on generic price-fixing. I've got a plan to fix this broken market &amp; make prescriptions more affordable.
901,Elizabeth Warren,"The federal deadline to sign up for health insurance has passed, but Massachusetts is special. We want everyone to #GetCovered, so our deadline is January 23rd. Visit https://t.co/SdkzQJyQAW today to find a plan that works for you and your family."
902,Elizabeth Warren,"The Senate just passed the First Step Act, a bipartisan prison and sentencing reform bill that I supported. It includes important changes, but we've still got a long way to go. I'll keep fighting for a criminal justice system that delivers on the promise of equal justice for all."
903,Elizabeth Warren,Giant companies spent $1 trillion in giveaways from the #GOPTaxScam to juice their share price &amp; pad CEO pay – but wages hardly budged. My Accountable Capitalism Act would help ensure workers get a fair share of the record-breaking profits they help
904,Elizabeth Warren,Exhibit #237 of how Congress is broken. We worked all year to pass @SenatorHeitkamp's bill to fight the epidemic of missing and murdered Native women and girls. We convinced all 100 Senators! Now it's on life support because of 1 retiring Congressman? Pass #SavannasAct.
905,Elizabeth Warren,"The generic drug market is clearly broken, and it's time to fix it. Giant companies will hate my Affordable Drug Manufacturing plan. But I don’t work for them. The American people deserve competitive markets and fair prices."
906,Elizabeth Warren,"The federal government already contracts to produce vaccines and drugs for national emergencies. By publicly manufacturing generic drugs, my plan would:💊Lower skyrocketing drug prices.💊Increase competition in the generic drug market.💊Help address urgent medicine shortages."
907,Elizabeth Warren,The majority of generic prescription drugs are manufactured by just 2 companies. The lack of competition has twisted the market &amp; driven up prices. I’m introducing the Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act with @janschakowsky to fix this broken market &amp; bring down costs for families.
908,Elizabeth Warren,"It's been well over a year since Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, and the island still needs all the help it can get. I've been very glad to see small businesses in Massachusetts coming to the aid of our fellow US"
909,Elizabeth Warren,"With Ryan Zinke finally out, his deputy could take over the Interior Dept. David Bernhardt, an ex Big Oil lobbyist, has spent his career working to poison our environment for profit. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would keep this walking conflict of interest from getting promoted."
910,Elizabeth Warren,This ruling can’t go into effect while we continue to fight it in the courts. You can still sign up for health insurance in 2019 – but you must do it today. Go to https://t.co/bTC9R5FnQK right now and #GetCovered.
911,Elizabeth Warren,"Republicans have tried over &amp; over again to repeal the Affordable Care Act in Congress, &amp; failed every time. Now they’re trying to use the courts to strip health care from millions of Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions. We’ll fight this every step of the way."
912,Elizabeth Warren,"Heartbroken for this child &amp; her family. Heartbroken that this is happening in the United States of America. Every person should be treated with dignity &amp; compassion, no matter which side of the border they come from. CBP must provide answers about how this tragedy happened."
913,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m proud to partner with @repbenraylujan, @repmarkpocan, @RepStephenLynch, @CongBoyle, &amp; @janschakowsky on the Accountable Capitalism Act, which they introduced in the House yesterday. With their support, we’re closer to helping workers get the higher wages they deserve."
914,Elizabeth Warren,"For years, I’ve been pushing @usedgov to discharge the loans of students who attended the shady #4profit, Corinthian Colleges. @BetsyDeVosEd tried every trick in the book to get out of it, but a judge over-ruled her. This is great news for students."
915,Elizabeth Warren,"Honored to deliver the Commencement address this morning at @MorganStateU, an institution that cultivates strong leaders who fight for equality, justice and opportunity. Tune in live here:"
916,Elizabeth Warren,I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of #SavannasAct. This bill is uncontroversial and a crucial step forward to address a tragic problem afflicting Native communities. The Senate has already passed it unanimously. The House should too.
917,Elizabeth Warren,"It's time to hold our allies &amp; ourselves accountable for the devastation in Yemen. Today, we're 1 step closer. The Senate just passed S.J. Res 54, which I proudly co-sponsored, to end US support for Saudi Arabia's war.Now, @SpeakerRyan &amp; @HouseGOP must stop dodging &amp; step up."
918,Elizabeth Warren,"The housing crisis is especially hard on communities of color that have faced decades of discrimination. My bill, introduced in the House by @RepRichmond, @RepGwenMoore, @RepBarbaraLee, and @RepCummings, would help families buy homes and close the racial wealth gap."
919,Elizabeth Warren,Dictators around the world are shelling out millions of dollars to Washington lobbyists to try and curry favor with @realDonaldTrump. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would ban Americans from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.
920,Elizabeth Warren,"Last year, @WellsFargo CEO Tim Sloan told me he really values his employees. Since then, he’s announced plans to fire more than 20k of them while dedicating $60 billion to stock buybacks for shareholders (like himself). I’d say it’s pretty clear what he values."
921,Elizabeth Warren,"My American Housing &amp; Economic Mobility Act would cut rents by 10%, invest in people living in historically redlined communities, &amp; create 1.5M jobs. I'm proud to join @OfficialCBC Chairman @RepRichmond as he introduces it in the House today. Tune in now:"
922,Elizabeth Warren,"From reporters and editors to press operators and custodial staff, workers at the @DailyHampGaz and the @ValleyAdvocate produce high-quality local journalism. They have the right to make their voices heard and unionize. I'm with them in this fight."
923,Elizabeth Warren,"Just like the hateful terrorism of Al Qaeda and ISIS, domestic right-wing terrorism is completely incompatible with our American values. It is a threat to American safety and security, and we must not tolerate it in the United States."
924,Elizabeth Warren,"The generic drug market is broken. Companies are allegedly colluding behind the scenes to keep prices high, while American families pay the price. Later this month, I'll introduce new legislation to help put a stop to this &amp; bring down costs for"
925,Elizabeth Warren,There are just 5 days left to #GetCovered for 2019. Go to https://t.co/bTC9R5FnQK to find a plan that works for you and your family!
926,Elizabeth Warren,"As head of the @EPA, Andrew Wheeler is supposed to regulate the coal industry. Instead, the former coal lobbyist is making it easier for his buddies to pollute our air. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would slam the revolving door shut on ex-lobbyists like Wheeler."
927,Elizabeth Warren,"Our brave firefighters truly do put their lives on the line, each and every day they’re on the job. My heart goes out to the entire @WorcesterFD, as well as the family and friends of Firefighter Christopher Roy."
928,Elizabeth Warren,I saw firsthand how @DHSgov separated mothers from their babies in detention. The world watched as they tear gassed migrant children seeking asylum. None of it has made our country any safer – and neither will spending billions of taxypayer dollars on a border wall.
929,Elizabeth Warren,"On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, I’m thinking of Betty, and the millions of Americans who stepped up to serve when their country needed them most. Thank you for your service."
930,Elizabeth Warren,"The US Cadet Nurse Corps Service Recognition Act will recognize former Cadet Nurses’ service to our country and provide them with honorable discharges, ribbon and medal privileges, and burial privileges."
931,Elizabeth Warren,"Betty Beecher was one of 120,000 women who served as Cadet Nurses during WWII. I talked with her about her years of service, and my bipartisan bill to honor America’s Cadet Nurses."
932,Elizabeth Warren,.@FEMA should be using taxpayer dollars to repair homes in Puerto Rico that were destroyed after Hurricane Maria – not helping companies with ties to @realDonaldTrump line their own pockets. I’m calling on @DHSOIG to investigate.
933,Elizabeth Warren,"The VA is supposed to serve the healthcare needs of America's veterans – not the business interests of @realDonaldTrump's Mar-a-Lago cronies. I've already gotten an independent gov’t watchdog to investigate, and I’ll keep pushing the @VetAffairsOIG to fully address this scandal."
934,Elizabeth Warren,Kathy Kraninger has no interest in fighting for American families &amp; zero experience standing up for consumers. The @SenateGOP just voted to put her in charge of the @CFPB anyway.Kraninger may be on the side of cheating companies – but I won't stop fighting for working families.
935,Elizabeth Warren,"US firms shouldn’t do the dirty work of repressive regimes and ruthless dictators. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would ban Americans from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. If other countries want to make their case, they can use their diplomats."
936,Elizabeth Warren,"Last week, I asked MSL Group and other US lobbying firms to explain their work representing the interests of Saudi Arabia in the wake of Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. MSL responded that they’re continuing business as usual and still working for the Saudis. https://t.co/GoW1WoJkbD"
937,Elizabeth Warren,Saudi Arabia used American lobbyists to rent hundreds of Trump hotel rooms and dupe veterans into secretly pushing the Saudis' agenda. Bribing @realDonaldTrump is unconstitutional – but tricking veterans into lobbying for Saudi Arabia is totally legal. It shouldn't be.
938,Elizabeth Warren,My plan to #EndCorruptionNow is the most ambitious anti-corruption legislation since Watergate. @RepJayapal &amp; @RepSarbanes have now introduced it in the House. We're working together to make sure our government really represents the American people.
939,Elizabeth Warren,We can't lose track of all of @WellsFargo’s scandals. Because on the end of every fake account or improper foreclosure is a person who suffers real harm. I'm still fighting to hold Wells Fargo and its executives accountable for the damage they've done.
940,Elizabeth Warren,The deadline for many Americans to sign up for health insurance is December 15th. Don't put this off. Go to https://t.co/bTC9R5FnQK and #GetCovered – today!
941,Elizabeth Warren,American workers have helped create record corporate profits – but their wages have stayed flat for decades as companies reward CEOs and wealthy shareholders instead. My Accountable Capitalism Act would empower workers and help them get what they deserve.
942,Elizabeth Warren,"Massachusetts grieves with the family and loved ones of Judge Joseph Tauro, who will be remembered for his tireless pursuit of justice for the marginalized and"
943,Elizabeth Warren,"I'm glad that @HouseDemocrats are planning to make anti-corruption a priority in the next Congress. Together, we can make our government work for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected. We can #EndCorruptionNow."
944,Elizabeth Warren,"George H.W. Bush was an American patriot who lived his life and served our country with dignity. From joining the Navy during WWII to the presidency, his devotion to public service was unmatched. Bruce and I send our heartfelt condolences to his family."
945,Elizabeth Warren,"We can start by passing my bill with @MarkWarner to impose massive, mandatory penalties on companies like @Equifax that expose people's personal information. We can’t allow companies to get away with leaving sensitive data vulnerable to hackers and"
946,Elizabeth Warren,"CEOs won’t take protecting our data seriously unless their own jobs are on the line. Instead of working to give giant companies like @Marriott even bigger handouts, Congress should focus on holding them accountable for these giant screw-ups."
947,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s time to #EndCorruptionNow. We can do it by passing my Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act, which was just introduced in the House by @RepJayapal. Together, we can make Washington start working for the American people again."
948,Elizabeth Warren,"If you’re elected to public office, your job is to serve the public. Full stop. That’s why I’m working with @HouseDemocrats and @House_DRTF to advance legislation that ensures public officials work for the public interest."
949,Elizabeth Warren,"This is exactly why we should require candidates to release their tax returns when running for federal office, and prevent Presidents from owning business empires on the side. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would do both."
950,Elizabeth Warren,"No candidate should be able to negotiate a business deal with a foreign adversary while running for office. But that’s exactly what @realDonaldTrump did, according to his ex-crony Michael Cohen. This is a textbook case of corruption."
951,Elizabeth Warren,"I wrote about how we can pursue a foreign policy that keeps our country secure and serves American workers, not just wealthy elites. It won't be easy – but I believe we can do it together."
952,Elizabeth Warren,"Earlier today, I talked about my vision for a foreign policy that works for all Americans. I believe we can defend our democracy and fight for our workers at the same time. Read my full speech here:"
953,Elizabeth Warren,Thomas Farr never should have been nominated for a federal judgeship in the first place. @SenatorTimScott's decision to vote no on Farr will keep him off the bench for now. We'll keep fighting to stop nominees like Farr from tilting our courts in favor of the rich and powerful.
954,Elizabeth Warren,Working families need a @CFPB Director with a proven track record of fighting for consumers. Someone who is willing to go after companies that cheat them. Kathy Kraninger is not that person. I’m calling on my Senate colleagues to reject her nomination.
955,Elizabeth Warren,"Americans are an adaptive, resilient people, and we have met hard challenges head on before. We can work together, as we have before, to strengthen democracy at home and abroad. We can build a foreign policy that works for all Americans, not just wealthy elites."
956,Elizabeth Warren,"55 years ago, when President John F. Kennedy spoke at @AmericanU, he said that, “our problems are manmade--therefore, they can be solved by man.” The same is true today. (OK, I’d add that they can also be solved by women, too.)"
957,Elizabeth Warren,The time for holding back is over. Patriots of every political persuasion must stand up to this type of behavior. Americans must demonstrate to @realdDonaldTrump and to the world that we are not sliding toward autocracy – not without a fight.
958,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump’s actions and instincts align with those of authoritarian regimes around the globe. And he is aided and abetted every step of the way by Republican politicians too pleased with his judicial appointments and tax cuts to stand up for fundamental American values.
959,Elizabeth Warren,"Here’s the thing about authoritarian governments – they are rotten from the inside out. Authoritarian leaders talk a big game, but their system is rotten because, by its very design, it stacks the decks for the wealthy and depends on corruption in order to survive."
960,Elizabeth Warren,"It also requires us to speak out against hateful rhetoric that fuels domestic terrorism of all kinds. We must speak plainly about all of these incidents. Just like the hateful terrorism of Al Qaeda &amp; ISIS, domestic right-wing terrorism is completely incompatible with US values."
961,Elizabeth Warren,"We must remain vigilant and fight for our democracy every single day. That starts with protecting our elections and democratic processes, and making it clear that there will be severe consequences for those – foreign or domestic – who meddle, hack, or undermine them."
962,Elizabeth Warren,"Investments at home strengthen the economy, but they also serve national security. A 21st century industrial policy, for example, would produce good jobs that provide dignity, respect, and a living wage, and it would also reinforce US international economic power."
963,Elizabeth Warren,"A foreign policy that works for all Americans must recognize that America can project power abroad only if we are strong and secure at home. But every day, shortsighted domestic policies are weakening our national strength."
964,Elizabeth Warren,"Let me propose three core nuclear security principles: 1. No new nuclear weapons. 2. More international arms control, not less.3. No first use."
965,Elizabeth Warren,"America should also be reinvesting in diplomacy. Foreign policy shouldn't be run exclusively by the Pentagon. Yes, we should expect our partners to pay their fair share. But diplomacy isn't about charity; it's about advancing US interests."
966,Elizabeth Warren,"It is time to identify which programs actually benefit American security in the 21st century, and which merely line the pockets of defense contractors. Then pull out a sharp knife and make some cuts."
967,Elizabeth Warren,The defense industry will inevitably have a seat at the table – but they shouldn’t get to own the table. US security and values should come ahead of the profit margins of private companies.
968,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump has refused to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia in part because he's more interested in appeasing defense contractors than holding the Saudis accountable for murdering a @washingtonpost journalist or for the thousands of Yemeni civilians killed by those weapons.
969,Elizabeth Warren,How do we responsibly cut back? We can start by ending the stranglehold of defense contractors on our military policy. It’s clear that the Pentagon is captured by defense contractors – and taxpayers are picking up the bill.
970,Elizabeth Warren,"Let’s cut our bloated defense budget. The US will spend more than $700 billion on defense this year alone. That is more than President Reagan spent during the Cold War. If more money for the Pentagon could solve our security challenges, we would have solved them by now."
971,Elizabeth Warren,"Let’s make sure that the three brave Americans killed in Afghanistan this week, including one who grew up in Boston, are the last Americans to lose their lives in this war. It’s time to bring our troops home from Afghanistan – starting now."
972,Elizabeth Warren,"Yes, we can – and we we must – continue to be vigilant about the threats of terrorism, whether from Afghanistan or anywhere else. But rather than fighting in an Afghan civil war, let’s help them reach a realistic peace settlement that halts the violence and protects our security."
973,Elizabeth Warren,"For nearly 2 decades, this country has been mired in a series of wars – conflicts that sap American strength. The human costs of these wars has been staggering: more than 6,900 Americans killed, another 52k wounded. Many more who live every day with the invisible scars of war."
974,Elizabeth Warren,"All three of my brothers served in the military. I know that our servicemembers and their families are smart, tough, and resourceful. But a strong military should act as a deterrent so that most of the time, we won’t have to use it."
975,Elizabeth Warren,"Just last week, our own government said that climate change is already happening and will dramatically endanger the world we share. The threat is real and existential – and we need to take action, now."
976,Elizabeth Warren,"Our economic policies should also address the challenges of today’s interconnected world, including areas like corruption, privacy and data rights, and climate change."
977,Elizabeth Warren,"We need a new approach to trade, and it should begin with a simple principle: our policies should not prioritize corporate profits over American paychecks.  That should be true for NAFTA and true for every deal we cut."
978,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump grabs headlines railing against @GM’s plans to axe thousands of American jobs in Ohio and Michigan – but his actual policies aren’t stopping them or other like them from continuing to put corporate profits ahead of American workers. It’s time for real change.
979,Elizabeth Warren,"I oppose NAFTA 2.0, and I will vote against it in the Senate unless @realDonaldTrump reopens the agreement and produces a better deal for America’s working families."
980,Elizabeth Warren,"There’s no question we need to renegotiate NAFTA. But as it’s currently written, Trump’s deal won’t stop the serious and ongoing harm NAFTA causes for American workers. It won’t stop outsourcing, it won’t raise wages, and it won’t create jobs. It’s NAFTA 2.0."
981,Elizabeth Warren,"For decades, leaders of both parties preached the gospel that free trade was a rising tide that would lift all boats. Great rhetoric – except that the trade deals they negotiated mainly lifted the yachts – and threw millions of working Americans overboard to drown."
982,Elizabeth Warren,"Our country is in a moment of crisis decades in the making. America’s middle class has been hollowed out, working people have been betrayed, and democracy itself is under threat. It’s time to create a foreign policy that works for all Americans, not just the rich and powerful."
983,Elizabeth Warren,I'm about to speak with students at @AmericanU about my vision for a progressive foreign policy that works for all Americans. Watch live here:
984,Elizabeth Warren,This is disgraceful. The #GIBill isn’t a handout – it’s earned by men and women who serve our country. We can’t go back on our promises to our veterans. The @DeptVetAffairs must fix this now.
985,Elizabeth Warren,"We currently spend more than the next 8 nations combined on defense. But every year, the Pentagon asks Congress for more. ""More"" is not a strategy. We need smarter investments in our security – and that includes refocusing on investments we should be making at home."
986,Elizabeth Warren,"The death of every American servicemember is a tragedy, but this one hits close to home. SFC Eric Emond grew up in Boston. My heart breaks for his family. The entire Commonwealth mourns his"
987,Elizabeth Warren,"In March, DOD told me it didn't track what targets warplanes armed and refueled by the US hit in Yemen. I’m glad we've stopped refueling, but it’s too late to repair the damage those warplanes have caused. I cosponsored S.J. Res 54 to end this war."
988,Elizabeth Warren,"The ugly truth is that by continuing to enable Saudi Arabia, the US is complicit in the devastation in Yemen. S.J. Res 54 will help us hold our allies – and ourselves – accountable. I’m proud to have been an early co-sponsor. I’ll keep fighting to end US support for this war."
989,Elizabeth Warren,"A new report from @RWDSU calls out Amazon for shameful conditions at their warehouses, and efforts to block employees from unionizing. ALL workers have the right to organize and work in safe conditions. @Amazon shouldn't get a pass."
990,Elizabeth Warren,"Thomas Farr has spent his career making it harder for people of color to vote in North Carolina. If we really believe our courts should defend equal justice under law, every single Senator should vote no on his nomination for a federal judgeship."
991,Elizabeth Warren,"This summer, I called for a review of @realDonaldTrump's Mar-a-Lago cronies who were trying to secretly run the VA. An independent government watchdog has agreed to investigate. Let's give our vets the accountability they deserve and #EndCorruptionNow."
992,Elizabeth Warren,"3 US servicemembers were killed in Afghanistan today. As we grieve with their families, we must ask: how many more must die for us to realize that no amount of US military power will fix Afghanistan? We have been at war for 17 years. It’s time to bring our troops home."
993,Elizabeth Warren,"The #GOPTaxScam has benefited shareholders &amp; CEOs, while American workers are being kicked to the curb. It's time to give workers at General Motors &amp; other big companies a stronger voice in corporate decisions. My Accountable Capitalism Act would do that:"
994,Elizabeth Warren,"General Motors just announced plans to lay off nearly 15,000 workers and shut down plants across the US. This is the same @GM that got a huge tax break from the #GOPTaxScam and spent $4.5 billion on stock buybacks last year. It’s shameful."
995,Elizabeth Warren,"Mothers and their children walked hundreds of miles and fled unspeakable horrors in the hope they would find asylum here in America. Instead of being met with compassion, they were tear gassed. This is wrong. It's immoral. We should be better than this."
996,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m in Lawrence, MA this morning with @SenMarkey for a Senate hearing on the gas fires and explosions that rocked the Merrimack Valley in September. We’re demanding answers and accountability from @ColumbiaGasMA. Watch live here:"
997,Elizabeth Warren,"Every day in Massachusetts, 5 people die from opioid-related overdoses. It’s time to tackle the #OpioidEpidemic head-on &amp; pass the #CAREact. My plan would provide $100 billion to our hardest-hit communities, &amp; give them the tools they need to fight"
998,Elizabeth Warren,"My plan would encourage companies to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources, and help reduce the risks of an environmental and financial catastrophe."
999,Elizabeth Warren,"Climate change is already happening – and we are not doing enough to stop it. If we don’t take aggressive action now, we risk destroying our environment – and our economy. We all have a stake in this, so we all need to work together to fix it."
1000,Elizabeth Warren,"America is in the middle of a housing crisis and only big ideas will solve it. My plan would build over 3 million homes, create 1.5 million jobs, and bring rents down by 10% – all without adding a dime to the deficit."
1001,Elizabeth Warren,"For years, garbage heaps claiming to be colleges stayed in business because a shady accrediting agency gave them its rubber stamp. The Obama Admin shut it down – but @BetsyDeVosED is bringing it back to appease her #4profit pals. Congress must investigate. We owe it to students."
1002,Elizabeth Warren,"Yesterday, marijuana became available for legal purchase in Massachusetts. There’s been so much progress at the state level. Now it’s time to end the federal ban on marijuana. I have a bipartisan plan to do that:"
1003,Elizabeth Warren,"30 years ago, Rita Hester, a Black transgender woman, was murdered in Boston. Every year, on #TransDayofRemembrance, we honor her memory, and the memories of all murdered trans Americans. We mourn, and we recommit ourselves to the fight for justice and equality."
1004,Elizabeth Warren,Toys “R” Us workers who lost their jobs and severances banded together and won $20 million from 2 former owners. That's great news – but it doesn't get the other greedy Wall Street firms off the hook. They should contribute and help make this right.
1005,Elizabeth Warren,"Student loan giant @Navient denied allegations that it cheated student borrowers – while sitting on a federal audit that proved it had done just that. The CEO should be held accountable for 1) sabotaging students in the first place, and 2) lying to the public to cover it up."
1006,Elizabeth Warren,"Over 5,000 American servicemembers may have to spend Thanksgiving on the southern border – instead of with their families. Our troops and their families deserve better than to be used as props, @realDonaldTrump. Let them go home."
1007,Elizabeth Warren,Big Pharma is trying to sneak a last minute change into the upcoming budget bill that would roll back changes to Medicare that make prescription drugs more affordable for seniors – all so they can increase their own profits. I refuse to sell out our seniors to Big Pharma.
1008,Elizabeth Warren,Congratulations to Boston @Marriott workers @UNITEHERE26 on winning a new contract! Their courageous fight shows us how much power working people have when they join together to demand a better future.
1009,Elizabeth Warren,".@Pfizer ""promised"" it wouldn't raise prices, then turned around &amp; raised them anyway. We can't count on drug companies to tackle rising drug costs, so Congress must. We can start by passing my bill to put a $500 monthly cap on what families pay for out-of-pocket prescriptions."
1010,Elizabeth Warren,This latest report of patient neglect at the Brockton VA is part of a troubling pattern of misconduct at Massachusetts VA facilities. Every veteran deserves the highest quality medical care – we can’t be satisfied until they get
1011,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump's cruel immigration policies haven't just torn apart families and damaged America’s standing in the world. They've also made some private prisons A LOT of money, without much oversight or accountability. That needs to end now."
1012,Elizabeth Warren,Losing even one of our firefighters is a tragedy. We have to keep them safe. That's why I pushed to pass a bipartisan law creating a national cancer registry to collect better data – &amp; better protect our firefighters. And I'll keep pushing for new measures to help them.
1013,Elizabeth Warren,"The Camp Fire is the deadliest in California’s history, claiming over 70 lives. Thousands of homes have been destroyed. More than 1,000 people are still missing. And the fire continues.Now’s the time to come together. Find out how you can help here:"
1014,Elizabeth Warren,Think it can’t get worse than Scott Pruitt? Andrew Wheeler will do anything to help the polluters he used to lobby for – including allow more toxic pollutants into the air our kids breathe. Now @realDonaldTrump wants him to run the EPA. It’s revolting.
1015,Elizabeth Warren,"UPDATE: @SenateMajLdr McConnell is making a last-ditch effort to push Thomas Farr's judicial nomination through the Senate. If he's confirmed, you can bet he'll keep working to disenfranchise African Americans and communities of color. We can't let that happen."
1016,Elizabeth Warren,"The #MVGasFires caused major damage &amp; forced thousands to evacuate. Everyone is working hard to rebuild – but we need federal help. I’m joining the entire MA delegation to urge @realDonaldTrump to approve federal assistance for Merrimack Valley families, businesses &amp; communities."
1017,Elizabeth Warren,"Banks are making a record amount of loans to companies swimming in debt, then pushing the risk to investors. Just like the pre-2008 subprime mortgage market, it’s a ticking time bomb that could blow another hole in our economy. Regulators must take action – before it’s too late."
1018,Elizabeth Warren,"A deal's a deal. After the @RedSox #BeatLA, @SenFeinstein and @SenKamalaHarris were good sports and settled their World Series wager with @SenMarkey and me. Congratulations to the Red Sox players, manager Alex Cora, and the entire organization on a historic season! #DamageDone"
1019,Elizabeth Warren,"It looks like Betsy DeVos will do almost anything to protect her for-profit college pals. That includes ignoring federal rules requiring her to forgive the loans of students who attended failed #4profits. Follow the law &amp; protect students,"
1020,Elizabeth Warren,"Americans know Washington isn’t working for them. But instead of giving up, more and more people are demanding a government that is run by the people, for the people – and my plan to #EndCorruptionNow would do just that."
1021,Elizabeth Warren,"The wealthy and well-connected want to keep Americans divided and stop us from fighting back against a rigged system. But change is coming to Washington, and we’re going to put the power back where it belongs – in the hands of the people."
1022,Elizabeth Warren,We have to follow through on our promises to our veterans. Congress expanded the GI Bill – now the VA needs to ensure vets get what they’ve earned. I introduced a bipartisan bill to make sure vets aren’t penalized financially for the VA’s mistakes. The Senate should pass it.
1023,Elizabeth Warren,"My heart goes out to everyone affected by the deadly California wildfires, especially those who have lost loved ones. Grateful to the many brave firefighters &amp; first responders who are putting their lives on the line to keep others safe, today and every day. America is with you."
1024,Elizabeth Warren,"All 3 of my older brothers served in the military. This #VeteransDay, I’m grateful for the service of our veterans and their families, and I'll keep working with my colleagues in both parties to put them first."
1025,Elizabeth Warren,"Yemen is in crisis – and we can no longer look the other way. Cutting off US refueling support is a start, but it’s too little, too late. We cannot continue selling the Saudis weapons that kill Yemeni civilians. We cannot continue to support this war."
1026,Elizabeth Warren,"For over 3 years, the US has helped the Saudi-led coalition bomb Yemen with few constraints. Thousands of civilians died in airstrikes. When I asked the Pentagon if it tracked the Saudi aircraft we refueled and the targets struck, they said they didn’t."
1027,Elizabeth Warren,"Wall Street fat cat @SecretaryRoss had huge financial interests in Chevron, Boeing &amp; Greenbrier but met with their CEOs anyway – potentially violating conflict of interest laws. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would prohibit these financial conflicts."
1028,Elizabeth Warren,"This week, @realDonaldTrump took his latest dangerous step in violating the #IranDeal, which has successfully blocked Iran’s path to a nuclear bomb since 2015. Unilateral withdrawal from this agreement isolates us from our allies and makes us less safe."
1029,Elizabeth Warren,Women escaping domestic abuse. Children fleeing gang violence. People facing persecution who come to America seeking asylum and the chance for a better life. @realDonaldTrump's latest attempt to slam the door shut on them isn’t just illegal – it’s cruel and immoral.
1030,Elizabeth Warren,"Late last night, at least 12 people died in a mass shooting in a California bar – including a police officer. My heart goes out to the families of the victims and those wounded. This cannot continue. Congress must move to #EndGunViolence – now."
1031,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump’s firing of Jeff Sessions brings us one step closer to a constitutional crisis. Congress must act to ensure that Special Counsel Mueller can do his job without interference.
1032,Elizabeth Warren,"This resistance is being led by women who are making their voices heard and fighting for their values. First, they marched. Then, they persisted. Now, over 100 are coming to Congress. And we’re just getting"
1033,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s time to break the stranglehold that the wealthy and well-connected hold over Washington. Together, we can save our government and make it work for the people. We can #EndCorruptionNow."
1034,Elizabeth Warren,"Massachusetts has the highest health care coverage rate &amp; some of the lowest premiums in the country, because we set tough rules for insurance companies &amp; insisted they focus on families over profits. And I have a plan to do that at the federal level too."
1035,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ve introduced the most ambitious anti-corruption legislation since Watergate. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would fundamentally change the way Washington does business, so that it starts working for the American people again."
1036,Elizabeth Warren,Republicans in Congress have spent years trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And @SenateMajLdr McConnell is still at it. The American people have come together time and time again to protect the ACA – and we're not about to give up.
1037,Elizabeth Warren,Wells Fargo charged 600k people for car insurance they didn’t need or want. Some saw their credit scores suffer or had their cars repossessed as a result. Now the bank says it needs until 2020 to refund customers? No way @WellsFargo – your bill is past
1038,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump's top economic adviser says the minimum wage is a “terrible idea."" Here’s what I think is a terrible idea: giving billionaires and giant corporations a $1.5 trillion tax break while kicking working families to the curb."
1039,Elizabeth Warren,"Senate Republicans have tried over &amp; over again to rip apart protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Now they’re trying to rewrite history to claim they care about patients. The GOP may try to change their tune, but they can’t change the"
1040,Elizabeth Warren,.@SecretaryZinke shouldn't have been confirmed in the first place. He's since used his position to benefit himself and his Big Oil &amp; Gas buddies. But now his conflicts of interest are finally starting to catch up with him. He should resign immediately.
1041,Elizabeth Warren,"I stand with those calling for an end to sexual harassment &amp; discrimination at @Google. My Accountable Capitalism Act would answer 1 of their demands by letting workers at big companies choose 40% of their Board members, giving them a real seat at the table. #GoogleWalkout"
1042,Elizabeth Warren,"Is Wilbur Ross working for taxpayers, or himself? He's been meeting with CEOs of companies where his family has major financial stakes. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would ban officials like @SecretaryRoss from owning company stocks while in office."
1043,Elizabeth Warren,"Hey, Massachusetts – starting today, you can get health insurance for 2019 by visiting https://t.co/xmng9Uwjmp. Don't forget to #StayCovered!"
1044,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump said his steel tariffs would help the US steel industry. Instead, @CommerceGov gave hundreds of exemptions to subsidiaries of Chinese &amp; Japanese companies. Charging American firms more while foreign companies skate by is just plain wrong."
1045,Elizabeth Warren,"Payday lenders contributed over $60k to @MickMulvaneyOMB’s political campaigns – and they sure are getting their money’s worth. Instead of protecting consumers, Mulvaney is preparing to gut the @CFPB rules that stop payday lenders from ripping people off."
1046,Elizabeth Warren,"Since taking office, @SecretaryZinke has used government funds to benefit friends, family, &amp; donors. Now @TheJusticeDept is investigating his unethical behavior, &amp; I'm calling on him to refund taxpayers &amp; stop using his public office for personal gain."
1047,Elizabeth Warren,".@SecretaryZinke is being investigated by his own department for corruption. Even worse, he tried to replace the lead investigator with a political appointee. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would empower government watchdogs to do their jobs, without fear of political payback."
1048,Elizabeth Warren,"The lives of Maurice Stallard and Vicki Lee Jones were brutally cut short, for no reason other than the color of their skin. We must work together to end the hatred and violence that has claimed far too many"
1049,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump didn’t invent government corruption – but he’s certainly doing his best to perfect it. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would stop the kind of blatant self-dealing that’s become a hallmark of the Trump Administration.
1050,Elizabeth Warren,"Generations of housing discrimination by the federal gov't mean the average white family has 10x more wealth than the average Black family. My new plan would help families of color buy homes &amp; build wealth, so we can start to close the racial wealth gap."
1051,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ve been working with my MA colleagues, @SenMarkey, @nikiinthehouse, &amp; @teammoulton, to get emergency assistance for those affected by the #MVGasFires. Glad to report that @SBAgov will now provide low-interest loans to impacted small biz &amp; non-profits."
1052,Elizabeth Warren,Every person should be able to practice their faith freely and without fear.Every house of worship should be a haven – not a hunting ground.Yesterday's attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue was meant to inspire fear and divide us – but that is not the America we will be.
1053,Elizabeth Warren,"My heart goes out to the families of those killed today in Pittsburgh, &amp; to the brave officers who risked their lives to protect others. The attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue was a horrific act of evil. We must recognize this hatred for what it is, &amp; come together to fight it."
1054,Elizabeth Warren,"70% of adults who misuse prescription opioids get them from friends or relatives. I fought to pass a bipartisan bill that lets patients partially fill opioid prescriptions. By disposing of unused medication today, you can help fight the #OpioidEpidemic."
1055,Elizabeth Warren,I want every single transgender child to know this: You are valued. You are equal. You are not alone – we are in this fight with you. Trans people #WontBeErased.
1056,Elizabeth Warren,"More resources, more people – @ColumbiaGasMA needs to do whatever it takes to make sure homes damaged in the #MVGasFires have gas service before winter sets in. @SenMarkey and I have requested emergency heating funds be made available to affected"
1057,Elizabeth Warren,"Legislation to combat the opioid crisis was signed into law this week. It includes major parts of my proposal with @SenJoniErnst, the Women Veterans Peer Counseling Enhancement Act, to strengthen the @DeptVetAffairs' peer counseling program for women vets."
1058,Elizabeth Warren,"In 2015, consulting firm @McKinsey prepared an internal report on public opinion of the Saudi government. Now it seems that report helped the Saudis silence and punish critics like Jamal Khashoggi. I'm calling on McKinsey to explain how this happened."
1059,Elizabeth Warren,"My new plan, the Accountable Capitalism Act, would stop CEOs from cashing in on buybacks and empower workers at big companies like @WellsFargo to select 40% of the company’s Board. It’s time American workers got what they deserved."
1060,Elizabeth Warren,"Last year, @WellsFargo CEO Tim Sloan told me he really values his employees. Since then, he’s announced plans to fire more than 20k of them while dedicating $60 billion to stock buybacks for shareholders (like himself). I’d say it’s pretty clear what he values."
1061,Elizabeth Warren,"Rents are skyrocketing, &amp; too many working families have to skimp on essentials just to keep a roof over their heads. My new plan, the American Housing &amp; Economic Mobility Act, would bring rents down 10% &amp; create 1.5M jobs – without adding to the deficit."
1062,Elizabeth Warren,"Violence against private citizens, public officials and media organizations has no place in our democracy. I am thankful for the bold and swift action of law enforcement to ensure no one was hurt."
1063,Elizabeth Warren,"Game on, @SenFeinstein and @SenKamalaHarris!They're no Fenway Franks, but @SenMarkey and I are looking forward to a few Dodger Dogs once the @RedSox #BeatLA in the #WorldSeries. #DoDamage"
1064,Elizabeth Warren,The opioid epidemic is relentless. Trump’s “emergency” response? Speeding up a few grants and other half measures. It’s not nearly enough. A new GAO report from @PattyMurray &amp; me shows that @realDonaldTrump broke his promise to address the #OpioidEpidemic.
1065,Elizabeth Warren,"Radical, right-wing groups are working to capture our courts by conducting secret trainings meant to indoctrinate law students who go to work for federal judges. We must stop groups like @Heritage from rigging our courts in favor of the rich and powerful."
1066,Elizabeth Warren,"Non-compete agreements squash healthy competition by blocking workers from finding betters jobs with higher wages. My bill with @ChrisMurphyCT and @RonWyden, the Workforce Mobility Act, would put an end to this practice that harms hard-working Americans."
1067,Elizabeth Warren,"Now @Buzzfeed reports that Saudi Arabia's partner in Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, hired a team of American mercenaries to assassinate its political enemies. This is not how our allies should act. We must withdraw support for the Saudi/UAE war in Yemen.https://t.co/lgaL0ANs2G"
1068,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump is so hellbent on building more nuclear weapons, he wants to cancel a treaty signed by Ronald Reagan. The INF has prevented an arms race in Europe for 30 years. Russia has violated it, &amp; we should hold Putin accountable. Withdrawing just makes America less safe."
1069,Elizabeth Warren,"We need to work together at all levels of gov't to solve America's housing crisis. I just met with local officials at the Springfield Housing Authority about my plan to build 3 million homes and bring rents down by 10%, so we can help families find decent homes at decent prices."
1070,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump is trying to roll back major civil rights protections for transgender people. As hard as he tries to stir up hate and divide us, we’ll fight back 10 times harder. 1.4 million transgender Americans #WontBeErased."
1071,Elizabeth Warren,"American workers have helped create record corporate profits, but average wages are still flat. My plan, the Accountable Capitalism Act, would force big companies to take workers' interests into account, and ensure workers get what they deserve."
1072,Elizabeth Warren,"Saudi Arabia has had 2 weeks to get its story straight about the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and “a fistfight that led to his death” was the best they could do? @realDonaldTrump should be holding the Saudis accountable – not pushing their propaganda."
1073,Elizabeth Warren,My plan to #EndCorruptionNow in 6 steps:✅Padlock the revolving door✅Force candidates to disclose their tax returns✅End lobbying as we know it✅Stop corporate capture of rule-making✅Make our courts more open &amp; transparent✅Hire a new sheriff to police corruption
1074,Elizabeth Warren,Workers have the right to organize on the job without their employer threatening or spying on them. But @Amazon reportedly sent an anti-union video to @WholeFoods managers encouraging them to do just that. @SenSanders &amp; I are calling Jeff Bezos
1075,Elizabeth Warren,"The Saudi regime's brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi shows us that some will stop at nothing to silence the truth. His final column, published today, is a piercing example of the importance of a free press. I hope @realDonaldTrump reads it."
1076,Elizabeth Warren,Corruption eats away at the heart of democracy. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow will make sure government represents the people – not just the wealthy and well-connected.
1077,Elizabeth Warren,.@WellsFargo CEO Tim Sloan was a senior manager during the bank’s fake accounts scam &amp; other scandals. How can Wells clean up its act while he’s still in charge? The @FederalReserve shouldn’t lift its growth restriction on the bank until Sloan is fired.
1078,Elizabeth Warren,"After giving billionaires and giant companies a $1.5 trillion tax cut and blowing up the deficit, Republicans are preparing to slash Medicare and Social Security to pay for it. The #GOPTaxScam isn’t “reform” – it’s a heist, and hard-working Americans will be left empty-handed."
1079,Elizabeth Warren,Money buys influence &amp; power in Washington – the Saudis know that better than anyone. They've spent millions lobbying the Admin &amp; Congress. Is it any wonder @realDonaldTrump won't stand up to them? My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would ban lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.
1080,Elizabeth Warren,"America’s housing crisis is devastating rural communities, but I have a plan to fix it. My American Housing and Economic Mobility Act would bring down housing costs for renters and buyers in rural areas – without adding a dime to the deficit."
1081,Elizabeth Warren,"A bunch of Wall Street firms pushed Toys “R” Us into liquidation and put 30,000 Americans out of work – without the severance pay they earned. I asked those firms why they're refusing to help the families they screwed over."
1082,Elizabeth Warren,A federal judge has ordered that the Trump Admin must ensure students who’ve been cheated by #4profit colleges get the loan forgiveness they deserve. This is a huge win for students – &amp; a major blow to @BetsyDeVosED and her buddies in the #4profit
1083,Elizabeth Warren,"Hundreds of veterans &amp; seniors had their Social Security, disability, &amp; other benefits stolen after security breaches at Comerica. The bank receives taxpayer money to manage federal benefits for 4.5M Americans – it should be working harder to protect them from scammers &amp; thieves."
1084,Elizabeth Warren,"Step 1: GOP explodes the deficit with $1.5 trillion in tax giveaways to wealthy donors.Step 2: GOP uses the deficit they created as an excuse to slash Social Security and Medicare. Americans see right through this shameless and destructive two-step, @SenateMajLdr McConnell."
1085,Elizabeth Warren,The Saudis bailed out @realDonaldTrump’s failed businesses for years. How much money did he take? What's the going rate to get the President to act as a mouthpiece for a Saudi king? Trump should release his tax returns so we can find out. #EndCorruptionNow
1086,Elizabeth Warren,We shouldn’t have to beg elected officials to disclose their financial interests – that's why I've released my tax returns from the past 10 years. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would force @realDonaldTrump &amp; all federal candidates to release theirs
1087,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s time to break the stranglehold that the wealthy and well-connected hold over Washington. Together, we can save our government and make it work for the people. We can #EndCorruptionNow."
1088,Elizabeth Warren,"On Friday, I met hotel workers on the picket line. They’re striking to demand better working conditions and higher wages from @marriott – because #1job should be enough to make ends meet. Stay strong together, @UNITEHERE26. Together, we win."
1089,Elizabeth Warren,Saudi Arabia – a country that's bombed thousands of innocent Yemenis &amp; stands accused of murdering journalist Jamal Khashoggi – is shelling out millions to lobby the Trump Admin. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would ban Americans from lobbying for foreign governments like Saudi.
1090,Elizabeth Warren,"Decades of federal discrimination have excluded generations of Black Americans from homeownership, &amp; skyrocketing rents make it even harder to save for a home. I talked with @TheRevAl about my plan to provide down payment assistance, bring down rents 10%, &amp; build a better future."
1091,Elizabeth Warren,This preliminary @NTSB report confirms that @ColumbiaGasMA caused the #MVgasfires – and it appears to have been preventable. I will keep pushing for more details from Columbia Gas &amp; NTSB to ensure nothing like this ever happens again.
1092,Elizabeth Warren,"Americans know Washington isn’t working for them. But instead of giving up, more and more people are demanding a government that is run by the people, for the people – and my plan to #EndCorruptionNow would do just that."
1093,Elizabeth Warren,Congratulations to @RevDrBarber on winning the MacArthur Grant. His work to bring poor and marginalized Americans together to demand a government that works for them is powerfully important. He’s an inspiring moral leader and a courageous fighter.
1094,Elizabeth Warren,The weapons we sell to the Saudis are being used to continue a war in Yemen that has killed thousands of civilians &amp; displaced millions. But the Trump Admin would rather support defense contractors than stand up to the Saudis and their human rights abuses.
1095,Elizabeth Warren,Saudi Arabia owes the world an explanation of what happened to journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But @realDonaldTrump is too busy padding defense industry profits with arms sales to the Saudis to demand answers.I stand with my Senate colleagues calling for an investigation.
1096,Elizabeth Warren,"The Supreme Court has allowed a North Dakota voter ID requirement that could disenfranchise thousands of Native Americans. This unjust decision highlights why we must pass @SenatorTomUdall's Native American Voting Rights Act, which I'm proud to cosponsor. https://t.co/yvGScReVnB"
1097,Elizabeth Warren,Massachusetts has a thriving Hispanic community that makes huge additions to our Commonwealth and our country. I’m proud to fight alongside strong Latino leaders like @SoniaChangDiaz and @danrivera01843. #MesDeLaHerenciaHispana #HispanicHeritageMonth
1098,Elizabeth Warren,"I'll be voting in favor of @SenatorBaldwin’s resolution to overturn the Trump Admin's expansion of junk insurance plans. And if Senate Republicans really care about protecting Americans with pre-exisiting conditions, they should too."
1099,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s long past time to reexamine why we’re in Afghanistan, and whether keeping our troops there is making us any safer. It’s long past time to bring our troops home. And when they return, we need to make sure they get the health care, GI benefits, and support they've earned."
1100,Elizabeth Warren,"We went to Afghanistan to defeat al-Qaeda – instead we have become deeply involved in a civil war that no amount of American military willpower, elbow grease, or ingenuity will bring to an end."
1101,Elizabeth Warren,"This week marks the beginning of America’s 18th year at war in Afghanistan. During that time, more than 2,000 brave US servicemembers have been killed, over 20,000 wounded, and tens of thousands of civilians have died."
1102,Elizabeth Warren,Student loan giant @Navient cheated students left and right to boost its profits. Now the CEO thinks he can lobby his way out of accountability. Another reason to end lobbying as we know it and #EndCorruptionNow.
1103,Elizabeth Warren,.@SecPompeo should reverse the State Department’s decision to deny visas to unmarried same-sex partners of foreign diplomats. It’s a cruel and discriminatory policy that does nothing to enhance our national security.
1104,Elizabeth Warren,"300 Woburn households are without gas service tonight – while @nationalgridus continues to lockout 1,200 skilled @steelworkers who could be helping. Massachusetts families need this lockout to end now."
1105,Elizabeth Warren,"The US has quietly supported the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen for years. 10,000 Yemenis have died. Millions more have been displaced and are in need of humanitarian assistance. @RepRoKhanna and I write about why Congress has an urgent responsibility to"
1106,Elizabeth Warren,"Climate change is coming – fast. We must do more to stop it. I introduced the Climate Risk Disclosure Act to encourage markets to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources, and reduce the risks of environmental and financial catastrophe."
1107,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m about to go vote against Brett Kavanaugh. But first, I want to tell everyone who fought with us what comes next:"
1108,Elizabeth Warren,"This hurts. But even the fights we lose matter. Every time you called, and marched, and tweeted, you helped move us closer. And it was so close. It’s ok to step back for a minute and take a breath. But you cannot give up. We still need you in this."
1109,Elizabeth Warren,"I've seen the FBI ""report"" on Brett Kavanaugh. 4 things are clear:❌This wasn't a full or fair investigation.❌ It doesn't exonerate him.❌ The available documents contradict what he said under oath.❌ We must #CancelKavanaugh."
1110,Elizabeth Warren,Senate Republicans are preparing to confirm Brett Kavanaugh. Americans are angry – &amp; we’re fighting back.
1111,Elizabeth Warren,"Not even a full week for an FBI investigation. A single copy of the report given to the Senate. Less than an hour to review. This is a complete sham. @SenateMajLdr McConnell said he’d plow Brett Kavanaugh through, and that’s exactly what the GOP is doing – no matter the cost."
1112,Elizabeth Warren,Yarmouth police Sergeant Sean Gannon was shot &amp; killed on the job. His parents &amp; I believe we need stronger gun laws so no one else has to face such a tragic loss. We wrote in the @BostonGlobe about how Brett Kavanaugh could tank efforts to
1113,Elizabeth Warren,"Housing is too expensive and there’s not enough of it. Mayors in Massachusetts are doing their part – now it's time for Congress to act. My new bill, the American Housing and Economic Mobility Act would bring rent down by 10% and build 3 million homes."
1114,Elizabeth Warren,"The Trump Admin’s junk insurance plans discriminate against Americans with pre-existing conditions, &amp; don’t have to cover prescription drugs or ER visits. I’m adding my name to @SenatorBaldwin’s effort to overturn Trump’s junk plan rule &amp; protect people's health care.#NoJunkPlans"
1115,Elizabeth Warren,"Last night, the President viciously mocked a sexual assault survivor. @SenateGOP will have to decide whether to stand up to this disgusting behavior or not. But @realDonaldTrump will never silence Dr. Ford, or take away her strength and courage."
1116,Elizabeth Warren,"I just introduced new legislation to address the growing housing crisis, &amp; the effects of government sanctioned housing discrimination that have held back so many – especially communities of color. We can make the American dream a reality for more"
1117,Elizabeth Warren,"Americans are sick of the wealthy and well-connected running Washington to their own benefit. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would end self-dealing by elected officials, slam the revolving door shut, and end lobbying as we know it."
1118,Elizabeth Warren,"Congress should pass my bill to #EndCorruptionNow – so the public can review the tax returns of federal candidates and ensure they’re running to serve the public interest, not their own financial interests."
1119,Elizabeth Warren,We need financial information from our elected officials in order to vet them properly. It’s a shield against future corruption – and that’s why I’ve introduced a bill to force candidates to disclose their tax returns and disclosed 10 years of my own returns.
1120,Elizabeth Warren,If @realDonaldTrump was willing to go to such incredible lengths to hide how he really “made” his fortune – what’s stopping him now from bilking the presidency and American taxpayers for everything they’re worth?
1121,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump was the 1st presidential candidate in 40 years not to make his tax returns public. Maybe because he got over $400M from his dad to start out &amp; probably committed tax fraud. @nytimes’ reporting is likely just the tip of the iceberg – what else is he hiding?
1122,Elizabeth Warren,"Exhibit #237 of why anyone running for federal office should have to disclose their tax returns. Congress needs to pass my legislation to #EndCorruptionNow, which would force candidates (and @realDonaldTrump) to make their tax returns public."
1123,Elizabeth Warren,"@burgessev @SteveDaines @JohnCornyn Seriously, @burgessev? #2? I could smoke @SteveDaines any day of the week."
1124,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenSanders, @RepRoKhanna &amp; thousands of activists &amp; workers pushed @Amazon to do the right thing – resulting in a huge win for workers. But the @FightFor15 doesn’t stop with Amazon. We’ll keep fighting to raise the federal minimum wage &amp; ensure everyone makes a decent living."
1125,Elizabeth Warren,Another example of why we must #EndCorruptionNow from @BetsyDeVosED – who hired an ex #4profit lobbyist to decide if negligent college accreditor ACICS could keep its rubber stamp of approval. Big surprise: they sided with shady for-profits over students.
1126,Elizabeth Warren,"Brett Kavanaugh has lied repeatedly to the Senate, even while under oath.An aspiring Supreme Court Justice should be a person of integrity. Kavanaugh’s dishonesty should disqualify him from sitting on the nation’s highest court."
1127,Elizabeth Warren,"Hundreds of immigrant children are being moved in the dark of night from foster care &amp; shelters to the Texas desert. No school, limited legal access, &amp; little gov't oversight. We shouldn’t be shipping kids to tent cities – we should get them into stable homes as fast as possible."
1128,Elizabeth Warren,"America’s federal housing policy has been broken for decades. Generations of Black Americans have been excluded from homeownership. Rural housing is falling apart. Rents everywhere are rising. I have a new, bold plan to fix it:"
1129,Elizabeth Warren,The #MVGasFires were a terrible tragedy. Residents of the Merrimack Valley and people across Massachusetts deserve answers. And @ColumbiaGasMA needs to be held accountable. That’s why @SenMarkey and I worked to secure a Senate hearing:
1130,Elizabeth Warren,"We need a thorough, independent FBI investigation into claims of Brett Kavanaugh’s sexual misconduct. We can’t limit witnesses. We can’t limit the scope. The GOP is more interested in getting this over with than in getting to the truth. America deserves better."
1131,Elizabeth Warren,"Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting. So far, Brett Kavanaugh has refused over and over again to submit to one. He lied repeatedly while under oath. I don’t know when the full Senate will ultimately vote. But NOW is the time to make your voice heard."
1132,Elizabeth Warren,One way for Brett Kavanaugh to clear his name is to submit to an FBI investigation. But he refuses. And he won't release the thousands of documents from his gov't service. What is he hiding? A Justice should have honesty &amp; integrity. Kavanaugh has neither – he should withdraw.
1133,Elizabeth Warren,"I want to thank the millions of people who tuned in to listen to Dr. Ford’s testimony, and every single person who showed up today to support her. Listening to survivors matters. Making your voice heard matters – Dr. Ford proved that today."
1134,Elizabeth Warren,"Dr. Ford's testimony today is heartbreaking, credible, and compelling. Anyone watching can have no doubt she is telling the truth. I believe her, and I hope my Republican colleagues do too."
1135,Elizabeth Warren,"The events described by Julie Swetnick, Ms. Ramirez &amp; Dr. Ford are absolutely heart-wrenching. The idea that the Senate would continue this confirmation process without an FBI investigation is even more revolting. @realDonaldTrump must withdraw Brett Kavanaugh's nomination."
1136,Elizabeth Warren,Why do Republicans continue to stand behind Brett Kavanaugh? Why does @realDonaldTrump want Rod Rosenstein out?Simple: They want to protect the wealthy and well-connected above all else. And they’re willing to run over anyone who gets in their way.
1137,Elizabeth Warren,"We can build a better future for all our families: one with more economic security, more economic mobility, more inclusive communities, and more chances at finding a decent place to live at a decent price. We just need the courage to fight for it."
1138,Elizabeth Warren,My new bill:✅Makes record investments to build homes including in rural areas.✅Gets localities to scrap zoning rules that make housing more expensive.✅Helps first-time homebuyers in formerly redlined areas.✅Offers relief to families still struggling after the 2008 crash.
1139,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m introducing the American Housing &amp; Economic Mobility Act to build 3 million new homes in 10 years, bring down monthly rents by 10%, &amp; create 1.5 million jobs. By asking 10k of the richest families to pay their fair share, it doesn’t add to the deficit."
1140,Elizabeth Warren,"Rural housing in the US is falling apart. Decades of federal discrimination have excluded generations of Blacks from homeownership. Housing costs for everyone, everywhere, are skyrocketing – while America's wealthiest families shield billions from taxes. I have a plan to fix it."
1141,Elizabeth Warren,"Hurricanes Maria &amp; Irma killed thousands of US citizens and displaced thousands more. It's been over a year, and the Senate still hasn’t held a single hearing about their devastating effects on Puerto Rico &amp; USVI's health &amp; education systems. That’s wrong."
1142,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump is trying to turn the American Dream into a nightmare for working families. How about instead of punishing them for being poor, we ask the wealthiest to pay their fair share? Every kid deserves a chance to succeed – no matter where they're from. #ProtectFamilies"
1143,Elizabeth Warren,"Last year, @realDonaldTrump &amp; Republicans in Congress gave $1.5 trillion to billionaires &amp; big corps. Now that they’ve picked our pockets, they want to penalize immigrants who need help buying food &amp; accessing healthcare for their kids – the vast majority of whom are US citizens."
1144,Elizabeth Warren,"If @realDonaldTrump is ready to force out Rod Rosenstein, how much longer until he goes after Special Counsel Mueller? Every resignation and firing brings us one step closer to a constitutional crisis. Congress must immediately pass the bipartisan bill to protect Mueller."
1145,Elizabeth Warren,"If Republicans have blocked an FBI investigation, bullied Dr. Ford, &amp; tried to ""plow right through"" &amp; put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court – all while holding onto credible information about a second sexual misconduct claim – then this isn’t a confirmation. It’s a cover-up."
1146,Elizabeth Warren,Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen have claimed thousands of lives – but @SecPompeo supports continuing this war so we don't get in the way of potential weapons sales. Defense industry profits should not outweigh the lives of innocent civilians.
1147,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenMajLdr McConnell, @realDonaldTrump, and @SenateGOP are demonstrating why most sexual assault survivors never come forward. But it's not too late to do the right thing. Stop shaming Dr. Ford and twisting yourself into knots to ignore this. Call the FBI and let her testify."
1148,Elizabeth Warren,"Hey, @SenMajLdr McConnell, @realDonaldTrump, &amp; @SenateGOP: Dr. Ford is not a nuisance. She’s certainly not a speed-bump to ""plow"" over. She is a person. And it shouldn’t be this difficult for the most powerful men in America to treat her with basic human decency and respect."
1149,Elizabeth Warren,"I met with @danrivera01843 in Lawrence yesterday about #MVGasFire recovery efforts. There’s a lot of work to be done – but we have dedicated professionals on the ground working to get things back to normal. In the meantime, I’ll keep fighting to hold @ColumbiaGasMA accountable."
1150,Elizabeth Warren,".@SecretaryZinke has opened up most of the US coastline to offshore drilling, undone key mining regulations, &amp; freed up millions of acres of public land to development. He's supposed to regulate Big Oil &amp; Gas – not do their dirty work. #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/G7ZebWIB1Z"
1151,Elizabeth Warren,".@MickMulvaneyOMB needs to explain why he met with Republican donors and campaign officials. If he asked for donations or political favors, he violated federal law. #EndCorruptionNow"
1152,Elizabeth Warren,"Another disgusting attempt to discredit Dr. Ford, who has risked her own safety and reputation in coming forward. Many survivors of sexual assault choose not to speak out, for a thousand different reasons. But when they do, they deserve to be heard, @realDonaldTrump – not shamed."
1153,Elizabeth Warren,"All 3 of my brothers served, and thankfully, they all came back safe. On #POWMIARecognitionDay, we remember those who haven’t returned home, and their incredible sacrifice. I had the chance to honor this special group of veterans by dedicating a new Chair of Honor in the Capitol:"
1154,Elizabeth Warren,"A year after Hurricane Maria, @realDonaldTrump still refuses to acknowledge basic facts about how badly Puerto Rico was hurt. There’s still so much work that needs to be done – but I won’t stop fighting for our fellow US citizens in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands."
1155,Elizabeth Warren,"Un año después del #HurricaneMaria, @realDonaldTrump aún se niega a reconocer hechos básicos sobre la gravedad del daño a Puerto Rico. Todavía queda mucho trabajo por hacer, pero no dejaré de luchar por nuestros conciudadanos estadounidenses en Puerto Rico y las Islas Vírgenes."
1156,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenSanders y yo también presentamos un ""Plan Marshall"" de $146 mil millones para Puerto Rico y las Islas Vírgenes – un plan integral para invertir en la reconstrucción de las islas después de los huracanes Maria e Irma:"
1157,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenSanders and I introduced a $146 billion “Marshall Plan” for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands – a comprehensive blueprint for investing in rebuilding the islands after #HurricaneMaria &amp; Irma.
1158,Elizabeth Warren,"2017: @WellsFargo CEO Tim Sloan tells me I'm “using math inappropriately” when I say he'll need to fire 20k employees to meet his cost projections.Today: He says Wells will fire up to 26k workers, while doing billions in stock buybacks.Sloan's the one who should be fired."
1159,Elizabeth Warren,"Puerto Rico está tratando de reconstruir después de María, pero ha sido aplastado por su deuda. Presenté una ley para dar a los territorios de EE.UU que han sufrido una crisis una ruta hacia un alivio de la deuda y la oportunidad de volver a ponerse de"
1160,Elizabeth Warren,"Puerto Rico is trying to rebuild after #HurricaneMaria, but it's being crushed by debt. I introduced a bill to give US territories that have suffered a major crisis a route to comprehensive debt relief and a chance to get back on their feet."
1161,Elizabeth Warren,"Después de María, he presionado repetidamente para obtener una cifra precisa de víctimas en PR para comprender el alcance de la tragedia, planear para futuros desastres y asegurar que aquellos que perdieron a sus seres queridos reciban la ayuda"
1162,Elizabeth Warren,"In the months after #HurricaneMaria, I have repeatedly pushed for an accurate fatality count in Puerto Rico so we could understand the full scope of the tragedy, plan for future disasters, &amp; ensure those who lost loved ones receive needed"
1163,Elizabeth Warren,"Muchos boricuas dejaron sus hogares después de Maria. Algunos terminaron en MA, donde más de 300 mil personas tienen vínculos con PR. Presenté una ley para obligar a Trump a activar un programa para ayudar a los desplazados, lo que @FEMA se niega a hacer."
1164,Elizabeth Warren,"Many Puerto Ricans were forced to abandon their homes after #HurricaneMaria. Some ended up in MA – where 300k people have ties to the island. I intro’d a bill to force the Trump Admin to activate a program for displaced families, which @FEMA refuses to do."
1165,Elizabeth Warren,"Después de que Trump terminó de tirar toallas de papel, regresó a la Casa Blanca e ignoró las secuelas del #HurricaneMaria. Mientras tanto, he luchado para que los sobrevivientes reciban la ayuda federal que merecen. Aquí está todo en lo que he trabajado:"
1166,Elizabeth Warren,"After @realDonaldTrump finished tossing out paper towels, he went back to the White House and ignored the aftermath of #HurricaneMaria. Meanwhile, I’ve been fighting to get survivors the federal help they deserve. Here’s everything I’ve been working on:"
1167,Elizabeth Warren,"En enero, viajé a Puerto Rico y vi de primera mano la devastación causada por el #HurricaneMaria. Vi a nuestros conciudadanos estadounidenses enfrentando desafíos increíbles: cables eléctricos caídos, agua que enfermaba a la gente, y niños sin hogar."
1168,Elizabeth Warren,"In January, I traveled to Puerto Rico and saw firsthand the devastation caused by #HurricaneMaria. I saw fellow US citizens facing incredible challenges — power lines in the street, water that was making people sick, and children left homeless."
1169,Elizabeth Warren,"Hoy, hace un año, #HurricaneMaria devastó a Puerto Rico y a las Islas Vírgenes. La pésima respuesta del gobierno federal convirtió un desastre natural en una crisis humanitaria. Miles de ciudadanos estadounidenses murieron, y muchos siguen viviendo en condiciones difíciles."
1170,Elizabeth Warren,"A year ago today, #HurricaneMaria devastated Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands. The federal government's shoddy response turned a natural disaster into a full-on humanitarian crisis. Thousands of US citizens died. Many are still living under extremely difficult conditions."
1171,Elizabeth Warren,Brett Kavanaugh is up for a lifetime appointment to the nation’s highest court. Dr. Ford – and the American people – deserve a full investigation. Republicans shouldn’t rush this. We need to take the time to get it right.
1172,Elizabeth Warren,"We can keep our country safe AND uphold our values by helping those fleeing violence and persecution. @realDonaldTrump's decision to drastically cut the number of refugees allowed into the US isn't just bad policy, it's a total failure of US moral leadership. #StandWithRefugees"
1173,Elizabeth Warren,"Seriously? What good could an ex-lobbyist who represented pro-Russia groups possibly be doing at @HHSGov?My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would slam the revolving door shut on lobbyists who try to waltz into gov't, &amp; ban Americans from getting paid to lobby for foreign governments."
1174,Elizabeth Warren,"Brett Kavanaugh talking about his high school in 2015: “What happens at Georgetown Prep, stays at Georgetown Prep.”I can't imagine any parent accepting this view. Is this really what America wants in its next Supreme Court Justice?"
1175,Elizabeth Warren,"Low-wage workers are especially vulnerable to workplace discrimination and sexual harassment. It’s wrong, and it has to stop. I stand with @McDonalds workers who are striking today to protest sexual harassment on the job, and retaliation for reporting it."
1176,Elizabeth Warren,American companies like @Google shouldn't be developing new products to help the Chinese government spy on its citizens. My Accountable Capitalism Act would help reverse the relentless focus on maximizing shareholder value that leads American companies to abandon American values.
1177,Elizabeth Warren,"In some Native communities, the suicide rate for youths is 10x the national average. I’m introducing a bipartisan bill with @lisamurkowski &amp; @RepRaulGrijalva to help combat this devastating loss of life &amp; ensure that fewer Native families &amp; communities experience this tragedy."
1178,Elizabeth Warren,This is unacceptable. @ColumbiaGasMA needs to take real responsibility here – and part of that includes working overtime to help the thousands of families who have been affected by the #MVgasfires.
1179,Elizabeth Warren,"@kayhanley @SIRIUSXM Hi @kayhanley, I absolutely support the #MusicModernizationAct. I signed on as a cosponsor earlier today. Thanks for your work to help get this bill to the finish line – and keep making great music!"
1180,Elizabeth Warren,"The Climate Risk Disclosure Act will help investors determine climate-related risks, encourage markets to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources, &amp; reduce the risks of an environmental and financial catastrophe – all without spending a dime of taxpayer money."
1181,Elizabeth Warren,Markets need to take the many complex risks posed by climate change into account. This isn’t a radical new idea – @algore proposed something similar years ago. It’s a concrete step we can take today.
1182,Elizabeth Warren,"On the other hand, if the global community follows through on commitments to limit global warming and move away from the use of fossil fuels, oil and gas companies could be worth a lot less."
1183,Elizabeth Warren,"If climate change continues at this rate, sea levels will rise – putting companies with physical assets near shorelines at risk. More frequent superstorms will interfere with shipping. Longer droughts will result in higher food costs. That can all affect a company’s bottom line."
1184,Elizabeth Warren,My new Climate Risk Disclosure Act would force public companies to disclose critical information about how climate change could affect the value of their assets so that investors can make smart decisions with their money.
1185,Elizabeth Warren,"Before the 2008 crash, investors and the government failed to address growing risks in our financial system. We’re making the same mistake with climate change today – we know it’s coming, but we’re not doing enough to stop it. I'm introducing major legislation to help fix that."
1186,Elizabeth Warren,"To all those impacted by Hurricane Florence – especially those who have lost loved ones – know we are with you. Recovery won’t be easy, but the outpouring of volunteers &amp; donations from across America are proof that you're not alone. We’re in this"
1187,Elizabeth Warren,"Brett Kavanaugh has played along with the Trump Administration hiding tens of thousands of pages of documents from his time in government service, and now more questions. We need a full and fair investigation – what is he hiding?"
1188,Elizabeth Warren,"Christine Blasey Ford is brave, deserves to be heard, and treated with respect as she raises new questions about Brett Kavanaugh.  No votes until that happens."
1189,Elizabeth Warren,"10 years ago today, Lehman Brothers collapsed &amp; set off the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of families still feel its effects, even as bank lobbyists try to roll back the rules on our financial system. We can’t sit back &amp; let another crisis happen."
1190,Elizabeth Warren,The people of Massachusetts deserve answers from @ColumbiaGasMA about how these tragic gas explosions happened. @MassGovernor and Lawrence Mayor @danrivera01843 have said Columbia isn’t following through – I support the decision to have another company oversee recovery efforts.
1191,Elizabeth Warren,"The volunteers here in the Merrimack Valley are truly amazing. They don’t just ask what they can do – they walk right in, roll up their sleeves and say, “We’re here to do it.” Thank you to everyone who is helping out. You’re part of what makes MA so strong."
1192,Elizabeth Warren,"There were 3 gas explosions &amp; over 60 fires across 3 Merrimack Valley communities yesterday. The physical damage I saw in Lawrence was staggering. Right now, the focus is on safely getting gas &amp; electricity back on so people can return home. We will rebuild &amp; recover – together."
1193,Elizabeth Warren,"I'm heartbroken for the family and friends of Leonel Rondon, who died in yesterday’s gas explosion. My thoughts are also with all those who were injured and forced to evacuate. I will do everything possible to get to the bottom of how this tragedy"
1194,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m in Lawrence today, meeting with local officials, law enforcement, and first responders about yesterday’s devastating gas fires and explosions. Everyone is working together to make sure people are ok, and to get families back into their homes as soon as it’s safe."
1195,Elizabeth Warren,"My heart goes out to the families in Lawrence, Andover, and North Andover who are trying to pick up the pieces after dozens of fires &amp; gas explosions in the area. Grateful to all our first responders working to help. Massachusetts is strong – we will recover &amp; rebuild."
1196,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ll be talking with @andrewrsorkin tonight about the impact of the 2008 financial crisis, what we learned, and how we can protect working families from Wall Street’s worst instincts. Tune in live here at 7:00pm EDT:"
1197,Elizabeth Warren,"If we want to avoid another financial crisis, we need to start holding Wall Street executives accountable. I introduced the Ending Too Big to Jail Act to force law-breaking bankers to trade in their pinstripe suits for orange jumpsuits."
1198,Elizabeth Warren,"10 years ago this week, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. It was a key turning point in a financial crisis that would ultimately cost 9 million people their jobs &amp; millions more their homes &amp; savings. Many working families are still struggling to recover what they lost."
1199,Elizabeth Warren,The @CFPB was created after the 2008 crash to protect Americans from financial tricks. It's returned $12B to people who were cheated. Brett Kavanaugh has argued the CFPB is unconstitutional. Consumers will pay the price if he's confirmed.
1200,Elizabeth Warren,"US citizens were asking you for help after Hurricane Maria, @realDonaldTrump. We’ve spent the past year trying to get you and your Administration to give Puerto Ricans the assistance they deserve. Here’s a list – start anywhere. Start helping."
1201,Elizabeth Warren,Esther waited for days after Hurricane Maria to hear back from her brother in Puerto Rico.
1202,Elizabeth Warren,"Joseph wrote me on behalf of his neighbor, whose father died in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria because of an oxygen tank shortage and power outages."
1203,Elizabeth Warren,"Rachel is one of 300,000 people in Massachusetts who has ties to Puerto Rico. She wrote to me, asking for help for her family members who were left stranded after Hurricane Maria."
1204,Elizabeth Warren,"You can try and ignore the numbers, @realDonaldTrump. But you can’t ignore their stories. I heard so many from my constituents in the days after Hurricane Maria. People with family and friends in Puerto Rico who were desperate for information about their loved ones."
1205,Elizabeth Warren,"In the 10 months after Hurricane Maria, over 2k Puerto Ricans applied for funeral assistance. Mothers, fathers, grandparents. They died without water, without electricity, &amp; without a President who cares about the safety and well-being of ALL US citizens."
1206,Elizabeth Warren,"This is a flat-out lie, @realDonaldTrump. The Puerto Rican government raised the official death toll to 2,975 people after multiple, credible estimates. https://t.co/mkcqshrRjk"
1207,Elizabeth Warren,Today I’m joining @SenSanders and our colleagues to launch the #ExpandSocialSecurity Caucus. Social Security is a lifeline for millions of seniors and people with disabilities. Stopping cuts isn’t enough – we need to expand it.
1208,Elizabeth Warren,"Who is Kathy Kraninger, and why does @realDonaldTrump want her to run the @CFPB? Well for starters, she played a role in his Admin’s cruel family separation policy. @SenCortezMasto and I explain here:"
1209,Elizabeth Warren,"This is a crushing defeat for @BetsyDeVosED, and a huge win for students who have been scammed by #4profit colleges. Way to go Maura!"
1210,Elizabeth Warren,We’ve had over a year to change the laws that let @Equifax and its executives walk away unscathed after compromising the data of 148M Americans. Congress should pass my bill with @MarkWarner to hold credit reporting agencies accountable to consumers.
1211,Elizabeth Warren,"The Trump Admin has all the facts here – but continues to support a coalition that bombs schoolchildren on a class trip. It's wrong, and does nothing to make America safer. We should use our influence to bring an end to Yemen’s humanitarian crisis – not contribute to it. 2/2"
1212,Elizabeth Warren,"For months, Congress has raised serious concerns about US support of the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen. @SecPompeo’s response today makes a mockery of congressional oversight authority. It’s not a certification – it’s a rubber stamp for Saudi Arabia. 1/2"
1213,Elizabeth Warren,We cannot go back to the time of back-alley abortions. But that could happen if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court and helps overturn Roe v. Wade. We must #StopKavanaugh – the lives and futures of countless American women are at stake.
1214,Elizabeth Warren,"No, @realDonaldTrump – the Hurricane Maria response was NOT an ""incredible unsung success.” Nearly 3,000 US citizens in Puerto Rico died. I've spent a year pushing your Administration on its many failures there. You need to face reality and do your job."
1215,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, our country comes together to remember those who lost their lives in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. We also honor our servicemembers and first responders who put their own lives at risk to protect our country and keep Americans safe. We will never forget."
1216,Elizabeth Warren,Brett Kavanaugh's hearings may be over – but his confirmation is not a done deal. There is still time to speak out and make your voice heard. Americans came together before to save the Affordable Care Act. We can do it again and #StopKavanaugh.
1217,Elizabeth Warren,I’ll be on @BosPublicRadio with @JimBraude and @MargeryEagan today at 12:00pm. Tune in live
1218,Elizabeth Warren,"I sat down with @brianbeutler from @crookedmedia to talk about my big new plans to make companies more accountable to workers, &amp; put a stop to corruption in Washington. Listen to find out how these ideas are connected &amp; will help hard-working Americans:"
1219,Elizabeth Warren,I spent 5 months investigating the @Equifax breach. @RepCummings and I also asked the GAO to review it. Their new report describes in painful detail how Equifax failed to protect the personal information of 148 million Americans:
1220,Elizabeth Warren,"If we want credit reporting agencies to act responsibly with our data, we need to hold them accountable when they screw up. Under my bill with @MarkWarner, @Equifax would’ve paid at least $1.5 billion in fines. It’s been a year since the breach – Congress should pass it now."
1221,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump is planning to replace his cruel family separation policy with indefinite detention for children and their families. #FamiliesBelongTogether – and kids don’t belong in cages.
1222,Elizabeth Warren,"Tomorrow marks 1 year since @Equifax compromised the data of 148 million Americans. Like many people, I tried to freeze my credit after the hack. It was a difficult (&amp; painfully boring) process. I introduced the FREE Act to let people access &amp; freeze their credit file at no cost."
1223,Elizabeth Warren,"Newsflash, Brett Kavanaugh: Contraception is NOT abortion. Anyone who says so is peddling extremist ideology – not science – and has no business sitting on the Supreme Court. #WhatsAtStake #StopKavanaugh"
1224,Elizabeth Warren,"Republicans know how extreme Brett Kavanaugh's record is, so they're making up rules to hide it from the public. The American people deserve to know a SCOTUS nominee's views on issues like race and abortion. I stand with @CoryBooker and @MazieHirono."
1225,Elizabeth Warren,".@Fred_Guttenberg's daughter Jaime was murdered in the Parkland mass shooting. Earlier this summer, he and I talked about how courts can block the @NRA. Yesterday, Brett Kavanaugh, who wants to sit on the highest court in the land, refused to even shake his hand. #StopKavanaugh"
1226,Elizabeth Warren,My Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee fought hard today to #StopKavanaugh and keep this charade of a confirmation hearing from proceeding. We’re not done with this fight – now is the time to stand together.
1227,Elizabeth Warren,"This is not a drill. Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings start tomorrow. The Supreme Court, and the future of our country – are both on the line. If we’re going to #StopKavanaugh, we need you to speak out now."
1228,Elizabeth Warren,The American people deserve a Senate that insists on doing its job. What they've got is a Senate that bows to @realDonaldTrump and covers for Brett Kavanaugh. This isn't a SCOTUS confirmation – it's a charade. #WhatAreTheyHiding
1229,Elizabeth Warren,"The Constitution directs the Senate to provide advice and consent on all judicial nominees. We cannot effectively fulfill that duty when @realDonaldTrump refuses to disclose Kavanaugh's record. Senate Republicans know this, too – they just don't care. #WhatAreTheyHiding"
1230,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump's 11th hour move to hide Brett Kavanaugh’s record is unprecedented. When Justice Kagan was nominated, NONE of her WH records were withheld because of executive privilege. So what's in these documents? And why is Trump so eager to bury them? #WhatAreTheyHiding"
1231,Elizabeth Warren,"On the eve of Labor Day weekend, only days before the start of Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing, @realDonaldTrump announced he would stop the Senate from reviewing over 100k pages of Kavanaugh’s records from the White House Counsel’s Office. #WhatAreTheyHiding"
1232,Elizabeth Warren,"This Labor Day, as we celebrate the many contributions that unions make to our communities, I’m wishing all the best to the SHARE Union @AFSCME and @MarlboroughHospital as they negotiate to ensure great care for Massachusetts patients and good wages &amp; conditions for workers."
1233,Elizabeth Warren,"Unions built America's middle class, and unions will rebuild our middle class. Wishing a happy Labor Day to union members here in Massachusetts, and hard-working Americans everywhere."
1234,Elizabeth Warren,"Our country is full of heavy hearts today as we say goodbye to John McCain. We share a profound sense of gratitude for the life John lived, and the legacy of service and unwavering commitment he’s left us to cherish."
1235,Elizabeth Warren,"Under my new bill to #EndCorruptionNow, Americans would be banned from getting paid to lobby for foreign governments. If foreign countries want to express their views and influence policy makers, they should use their diplomats – not straw men who violate campaign finance laws."
1236,Elizabeth Warren,"When John McCain and I worked together, he’d say: “Show some fight. Get in there – throw some punches.” That was his approach to life – if you’re gonna be in a fight, you better give it your all. It was an honor to serve with him. A patriot, a maverick, a fighter to the end."
1237,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump spends millions of taxpayer $ playing golf at his own resorts &amp; hands out over a trillion in tax giveaways to rich buddies – but he wants to cut pay for hard-working Americans who care for vets, support military operations, &amp; inspect our food? I'll be voting no."
1238,Elizabeth Warren,.@SecretaryAcosta has launched a pilot program that lets companies who cheat their employees off the hook. @USDOL should be doing everything it can to protect the financial security of working families – not siding with corporations that steal from them.
1239,Elizabeth Warren,Corruption eats away at the heart of democracy. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow will make sure government represents the people – not just the wealthy and well-connected.
1240,Elizabeth Warren,"There was a time in America when workers &amp; investors each got a big chunk of the wealth they produced. But these days, workers who help create record corporate profits aren’t getting what they’ve earned. I talked w/@FranklinFoer about my ideas to fix that."
1241,Elizabeth Warren,"The Puerto Rican government just updated the official death count for Hurricane Maria from 64 to 2,975 people. @realDonaldTrump and his Administration utterly failed in their response, and US citizens died. That's the appalling, tragic reality."
1242,Elizabeth Warren,"I believe we can break the stranglehold that the wealthy &amp; well-connected hold over Washington. I believe we can get democracy up &amp; running again. I believe that together, we can save our government &amp; make it work for the people. We can #EndCorruptionNow."
1243,Elizabeth Warren,".@WellsFargo customers would be better off if CEO Tim Sloan focused more on addressing the dozens of scandals plaguing his bank, and less on getting a good journalist reassigned for doing his job (which includes reporting on those scandals)."
1244,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump’s pick to run the @CFPB said she doesn’t disagree with a single thing @MickMulvaneyOMB has done. The Senate should reject Kathy Kraninger’s nomination unless she commits to reverse Mulvaney’s betrayals of students and stand up for American consumers.
1245,Elizabeth Warren,"The @CFPB has returned $750 million to scammed student borrowers. But today, the agency’s top student loan watchdog resigned – because @MickMulvaneyOMB is siding with greedy student loan companies over students and military families. Disgraceful."
1246,Elizabeth Warren,"I count it as a blessing to have had the honor to serve with John McCain in the Senate and on the Armed Services Committee. If there ever was a true American patriot, John was that patriot. I’ll miss his strength and his maverick spirit, but most of all I’ll miss his kindness."
1247,Elizabeth Warren,"Democrat or Republican, foreign leader or President of the US, John McCain would go toe to toe with anyone to fight for what he thought was right. At a time when character &amp; integrity are under siege, we all mourn the loss of a public servant who lived with courage &amp; conviction."
1248,Elizabeth Warren,"John McCain and I disagreed on many things, and sometimes quite forcefully. But even when we disagreed, I always respected that his heart was focused on doing what he thought was best for the American people."
1249,Elizabeth Warren,"John McCain was fiercely devoted to his family, his constituents, and his country. My heart goes out to his family and loved ones during this difficult time. As a nation, we all share in the sense of emptiness his passing has left behind."
1250,Elizabeth Warren,"The GOP is trying everything it can to weaken unions. But we're fighting back every step of the way, &amp; it's paying off. A federal judge just struck down key pieces of @realDonaldTrump’s executive orders designed to roll back federal workers' rights. This is a big win for workers."
1251,Elizabeth Warren,"Trump’s plan to “regulate” greenhouse gas emissions reeks – of corruption. It’s lead by ex coal lobbyist @EPAAWheeler who’d rather appease his Big Coal buds than protect our environment &amp; American lives. Under my bill to #EndCorruptionNow, he wouldn’t be allowed to run the @EPA."
1252,Elizabeth Warren,"For decades, American workers have helped produce record corporate profits but have seen their pay barely budge. I have a big new idea to fix that and get working families what they deserve."
1253,Elizabeth Warren,"Most of the students participating in @50MoreMass were born after the Columbine shooting. They grew up in a different world. Now, they’re coming together to #EndGunViolence. This is how change happens. I couldn’t be prouder to support them. #50more"
1254,Elizabeth Warren,"I asked teachers in MA if guns in classrooms would reduce gun violence in schools. 92% of those I surveyed said no. If you really want to keep kids safe @BetsyDeVosED, let’s put more counselors &amp; mental health care professionals in schools – not more guns."
1255,Elizabeth Warren,Many schools can barely afford nurses or counselors for students – and teachers dip into their own pockets for basic supplies. Now @BetsyDeVosED wants to allow schools to use limited federal education $ to put guns – GUNS – in classrooms? That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard.
1256,Elizabeth Warren,"I just introduced a set of major reforms to #EndCorruptionNow so we can take power in Washington away from the wealthy, powerful, and well-connected who have corrupted our government, and put power back in the hands of the American"
1257,Elizabeth Warren,A climate related disaster could trigger a worldwide financial crisis the likes of which we’ve never seen before. It’s #TimeToWakeUp and take action. I’m proud to join @SenWhitehouse in the fight to protect our planet.
1258,Elizabeth Warren,My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would plug huge legal loopholes that allow sleazy fixers like Michael Cohen to rake in millions by giving corporations like @ATT and @Novartis access to federal officials – without ever having to register as lobbyists.
1259,Elizabeth Warren,"Americans know Washington isn’t working for them. But instead of giving up, more &amp; more people are demanding a government that is run by the people for the people – and I have a plan to do that. Here’s my speech outlining my new bill to"
1260,Elizabeth Warren,".@EricCantor, have you been listening? You spent so much time schmoozing with the rich and powerful that your constituents voted you out. Then you went to work for Wall Street. I’m shocked – SHOCKED – you don’t like my bill to #EndCorruptionNow."
1261,Elizabeth Warren,Since introducing my bill to #EndCorruptionNow this AM: Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign crimes. Paul Manafort convicted on tax fraud. Rep. Duncan Hunter indicted for misuse of campaign funds. And these are just the guys who've been caught. Time to clean up Washington.
1262,Elizabeth Warren,Today I introduced a sweeping anti-corruption bill to clean up Washington. My reforms would make it flatly illegal for Americans to work as lobbyists for foreign governments. Congress should pass this law so we never see another snake like Paul Manafort again. #EndCorruptionNow
1263,Elizabeth Warren,Paul Manafort lied about lobbying for a foreign government and got rich. And it's shocking that @realDonaldTrump's campaign mgr has been convicted of criminal tax fraud. But it's insane that ANYONE is allowed to take shady foreign cash to lobby our government. #EndCorruptionNow
1264,Elizabeth Warren,I plan to fight to pass as many of these reforms as possible. I believe we can break the stranglehold that the wealthy and well-connected hold over our government. I believe we can get democracy working again. #EndCorruptionNow
1265,Elizabeth Warren,"Inside Washington, some of these proposals will be very unpopular, even with my friends. Outside Washington, I expect that most people will see these ideas as no-brainers and be shocked they’re not already law. #EndCorruptionNow"
1266,Elizabeth Warren,Build a new anticorruption agency to make sure that all key federal officials – even powerful Senators and Presidents – file disclosures and get rid of conflicts. #EndCorruptionNow
1267,Elizabeth Warren,Big Change Number Six – Hire a new independent sheriff to police corruption. There are dedicated public servants that enforce our ethics laws – but they have less authority than security guards at the mall. #EndCorruptionNow
1268,Elizabeth Warren,"Strengthen the code of conduct for all federal judges – no stock trading, no payments from corporations for attending events, no honoraria for giving speeches, no lavish getaways &amp; fancy hunting trips funded by billionaires. &amp; I mean all federal judges, including SCOTUS justices."
1269,Elizabeth Warren,Fifth Big Change – Restore faith that ordinary people can get a fair shake in our courts. #EndCorruptionNow
1270,Elizabeth Warren,Prosecute companies that knowingly mislead government agencies. And stop the practice of companies paying for sham “studies” designed to derail the rulemaking process. #EndCorruptionNow
1271,Elizabeth Warren,Fourth Big Change – End corporate capture of rulemaking. #EndCorruptionNow
1272,Elizabeth Warren,"We should ban Americans from getting paid to lobby for foreign governments – period. If foreign governments want to express their views, they can use their diplomats. #EndCorruptionNow"
1273,Elizabeth Warren,Start by fixing the Swiss cheese definition of a “lobbyist.”  Require everyone who gets paid to influence government to register. And bring that lobbying out into the sunlight. Make every single meeting between a lobbyist and a public official a matter of public record.
1274,Elizabeth Warren,Third Big Change – End lobbying as we know it. #EndCorruptionNow
1275,Elizabeth Warren,"Presidents should not be able to own companies on the side. And we shouldn’t have to beg candidates to let the American people see their financial interests. That should be the law – not just for presidential candidates, but for every candidate for every federal office."
1276,Elizabeth Warren,"Second Big Change – Stop self-dealing by public officials. If a person works for the government, then that person should serve the public. No making policy decisions to help yourself instead of taxpayers. #EndCorruptionNow"
1277,Elizabeth Warren,Ban elected and appointed officials from becoming lobbyists after they leave office. Not for 1 year.  Not for 2 years. For the rest of their lives. No special deals for millions and millions of dollars to the policymakers who will be in a position to pay back their old employers.
1278,Elizabeth Warren,First Big Change – Padlock the revolving door between big business and government. #EndCorruptionNow
1279,Elizabeth Warren,The problem is enormous – but we’ve dealt with enormous problems before. We just need some big reform ideas and a willingness to fight for real change. #EndCorruptionNow
1280,Elizabeth Warren,"There’s no real question that the @realDonaldTrump era has given us the most nakedly corrupt leadership this nation has seen in our lifetimes. But they are not the cause of the rot – they’re just the biggest, stinkiest example of it. #EndCorruptionNow"
1281,Elizabeth Warren,"These reforms have one simple aim: to take power in Washington away from  the wealthy, the powerful, and the well-connected who have corrupted our  government and put power back in the hands of the American people.  #EndCorruptionNow"
1282,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, I’m introducing the most ambitious anti-corruption legislation proposed in Congress since Watergate. This is an aggressive set of reforms that would fundamentally change the way Washington does business. #EndCorruptionNow"
1283,Elizabeth Warren,"Our government systematically favors the rich over the poor, the donor class over the working class, the well-connected over the disconnected.  This is deliberate, and we need to call it for what it is – corruption, plain and simple. #EndCorruptionNow"
1284,Elizabeth Warren,Corruption in Washington isn’t a small problem – and we can’t fight it with small solutions. I’m about to unveil my legislation to #EndCorruptionNow and put a stop to it once and for all. Watch live here:
1285,Elizabeth Warren,Plenty of former lawmakers – Ds &amp; Rs – have walked through giant loopholes in current law so they can do the work of lobbyists without having to register as one. It’s time to put a lock on the revolving door. #EndCorruptionNow
1286,Elizabeth Warren,"The same day SCOTUS announced they’d hear #JanusvAFSCME, Justice Gorsuch was schmoozing with anti-union funders @ Trump Hotel. He later voted to strip public sector unions of the resources they need to support workers. Real impartial, huh?#EndCorruptionNow"
1287,Elizabeth Warren,Wall Street fat cat turned Commerce Sec Wilbur Ross left $2 billion off his financial disclosure forms during his confirmation. Now @SecretaryRoss is under fire for possible insider trading &amp; violating criminal conflict of interest laws. #EndCorruptionNow
1288,Elizabeth Warren,Payday lenders don't just prey on the vulnerable and lobby @MickMulvaneyOMB. They've also been caught interfering in academic studies meant to convince lawmakers that payday loans aren’t harmful to consumers. #EndCorruptionNow
1289,Elizabeth Warren,"4 months after @FCC Commissioner Meredith Baker voted to approve a huge merger between Comcast and NBC, she resigned. And you'll absolutely never guess where she went to work next! (It was Comcast-NBC.) #EndCorruptionNow"
1290,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s no wonder @realDonaldTrump's drug pricing plan does nothing to actually reduce drug prices. It was developed by a former Big Pharma lobbyist, and it’s being run by HHS @SecAzar, a former Big Pharma executive. #EndCorruptionNow"
1291,Elizabeth Warren,"Corporations don't just lobby, they also produce “unbiased” “research” to sway lawmakers. One Brookings economist was forced to resign after authoring a study that attacked a consumer protection rule – &amp; was funded by a financial firm.#EndCorruptionNow"
1292,Elizabeth Warren,"Lobbying isn’t just for Big Banks, Big Pharma, &amp; Big Oil anymore. Big Tech is in on the game too. Last year, @Amazon, @Apple, @Facebook, @Google and @Microsoft spent a combined $50 million lobbying Ds and Rs in the government. #EndCorruptionNow"
1293,Elizabeth Warren,I’ve been sharing examples of how corruption has seeped into Washington – and I’ve got a few more to add before I introduce sweeping new legislation to clean up our government and #EndCorruptionNow. You can watch live here at 10:00am:
1294,Elizabeth Warren,"Jared Kushner refused to divest from his holdings in Kushner Companies. Then he sucked up to executives from a big bank &amp; investment company with personal White House visits. In return, they gave his family business $509 million in loans. #EndCorruptionNow"
1295,Elizabeth Warren,How much is it worth to a bank to send its people into gov't? At least $232M. That’s how much the #GOPTaxScam handed to @GoldmanSachs in the 1st quarter after it passed – and former exec/Trump adviser Gary Cohn helped sell it to Congress. #EndCorruptionNow
1296,Elizabeth Warren,.@GoldmanSachs might as well change its name to “Government” Sachs. The bank has sent high-level execs (who leave with multi-million dollar gifts) into just about every D and R administration since FDR. And it keeps paying dividends. #EndCorruptionNow
1297,Elizabeth Warren,Acting @EPA head Andrew Wheeler is just as dirty as his predecessor. He’s a former coal lobbyist who's working to poison the agency – and the environment he’s supposed to protect – from the inside. #EndCorruptionNow
1298,Elizabeth Warren,"I tried, but 280 characters can’t even begin to cover all of Scott Pruitt’s acts of corruption and ethics scandals. #EndCorruptionNow"
1299,Elizabeth Warren,I've been sharing examples of how corruption has seeped into Washington. It’s a long list. Tune in live at 10am tomorrow as I lay out my plan to change the way Washington does business and #EndCorruptionNow. https://t.co/NPtrtGlTGo
1300,Elizabeth Warren,Washington’s revolving door is slick with oil money. @Exxonmobil had 29 registered lobbyists in 2016. 22 of them previously worked for Ds and Rs in the government. #EndCorruptionNow
1301,Elizabeth Warren,"Congress isn’t the only branch for sale. Justice Clarence Thomas attended a fancy Koch Brothers retreat, paid for by right-wing lawyers – &amp; accidentally “omitted” his wife’s work as a lobbyist on his financial disclosures... for 6 years. #EndCorruptionNow"
1302,Elizabeth Warren,"When former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost his seat, he went straight to Wall Street for a $3.4 million salary. Pretty sure he wasn't hired for his investment banker chops (because he has none). They wanted access and influence. #EndCorruptionNow"
1303,Elizabeth Warren,"Tom Price was later forced to resign from @HHSGov – after spending close to $1 million of taxpayer money on flights. (Oh, and another Congressman was just indicted for insider trading over the stock for that same company.) #EndCorruptionNow"
1304,Elizabeth Warren,"Former HHS Secretary Tom Price brazenly traded health care stock while in Congress, &amp; misrepresented the value of his stocks on financial disclosures. When I asked him about it in a hearing he said he was “offended by the insinuation” that he did anything wrong. #EndCorruptionNow"
1305,Elizabeth Warren,"Big Bank lobbyists have successfully chipped away at financial regulations, even when Democrats controlled the Senate and White House. Like in 2014, when @Citi slipped an amendment into a spending bill that reversed a key Dodd-Frank provision. #EndCorruptionNow"
1306,Elizabeth Warren,"I know for a fact that @BetsyDeVosED is the worst – and most corrupt – Education Secretary ever, because I’ve actually done my homework. I launched #DeVosWatch to track all her scandals at @usedgov. #EndCorruptionNow"
1307,Elizabeth Warren,".@BetsyDeVosED has refused to divest from her secret family trusts, and filled the Education Department with #4profit college hacks who have given away the store to grifters and crooks at bogus #4profit colleges. #EndCorruptionNow"
1308,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump is running the most corrupt administration of our lifetimes. Tomorrow, I’ll unveil sweeping new legislation to clean up our government. Until then, I’ll be sharing examples of how corruption has seeped into Washington. It’s a long list. #EndCorruptionNow"
1309,Elizabeth Warren,Corporations are making record profits &amp; top execs are cashing in huge bonuses – but workers’ wages are flat. That's because too many companies shovel out cash to wealthy shareholders and ignore the big picture. I’ve got a bold new plan to change that.
1310,Elizabeth Warren,"98 years ago today, the 19th Amendment was ratified. The women who won our suffrage were told over and over again to give up the fight. We have the vote today because they didn’t listen."
1311,Elizabeth Warren,The bomb that killed 40 children on a school bus in Yemen last week was sold to the Saudis by the US. This Administration must answer for our continued support of the Saudi-led campaign.
1312,Elizabeth Warren,"Next Tuesday, I’ll be speaking at @PressClubDC about my bold new plan to fundamentally change the way Washington does business. I’ll unveil sweeping anti-corruption legislation to eliminate the influence of money in federal government &amp; ensure it works for working families again."
1313,Elizabeth Warren,"For decades, big companies have made record profits while wages for working families haven’t budged. It didn’t use to be this way. We built America's middle class after WWII. We can get back to the time when American companies &amp; workers did well together."
1314,Elizabeth Warren,".@KCCorp will dole out $700-900 million in stock buybacks to help shareholders &amp; executives while cutting up to 5,500 jobs. @Kroger is closing 14 stores &amp; laying off more than 1,600 people while rewarding its corporate execs &amp; shareholders with $1.2 billion in stock buybacks."
1315,Elizabeth Warren,"Let’s look at some individual companies: @WellsFargo got a $3.4 billion boost from the #GOPTaxScam. It turned around and announced plans to close 900 branches, while rewarding executives and shareholders with tens of billions of dollars in stock buybacks."
1316,Elizabeth Warren,The #GOPTaxScam showered more than a trillion dollars on big American corporations – a huge windfall for wealthy shareholders and executives. But workers have seen their real wages go DOWN.
1317,Elizabeth Warren,"My big new bill, the Accountable Capitalism Act, would restore the idea that big American companies should look out for their workers, not just their shareholders. Why do we need to pass this bill? Just look at what’s happened since the #GOPTaxScam passed."
1318,Elizabeth Warren,"A free and independent press is one of the cornerstones of our democracy. I stand by the @BostonGlobe’s efforts to defend the First Amendment from @realDonaldTrump’s attacks, and to pursue and report the truth. #FreePress"
1319,Elizabeth Warren,I talked with @JimCramer about my new bill to hold businesses accountable to their employees – not just their shareholders. It starts by giving workers at big companies the right to select 40 percent of the company's board members.
1320,Elizabeth Warren,American taxpayers should not have to subsidize the abuse and exploitation of immigrants in private detention centers. @DHSgov has a legal and moral obligation to ensure that all people in their custody are treated with dignity and respect.
1321,Elizabeth Warren,"Over the last year, corporate profits have soared while average wages for Americans haven’t budged. It’s been the same sad story for decades. Today I’m introducing a new bill to help return to the time when American companies &amp; workers did well together:"
1322,Elizabeth Warren,The US has been assisting Saudi Arabia's military strikes in Yemen for 3 years. Thousands of civilians have died. The American people deserve to know the full scope of our operations in Yemen so we can hold our partners – and ourselves – accountable.
1323,Elizabeth Warren,"#WhatsAtStake in the fight for the Supreme Court? If Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed, he could be the deciding vote to uphold @realDonaldTrump’s cruel and reckless immigration policies. #ImmigrantsAtStake"
1324,Elizabeth Warren,"Our veterans deserve the very best – and at the bare minimum, they deserve a VA free of corruption. Instead, @realDonaldTrump has handed the department to 3 of his Mar-a-Lago cronies who are completely unqualified &amp; unaccountable to the public. I've called for an investigation."
1325,Elizabeth Warren,"The Trump Admin has decided that banks aren't part of the “financial services” industry, &amp; that they should get an additional $2.5 billion in tax giveaways under the #GOPTaxScam. There’s no limit to what @realDonaldTrump will do to reward his rich buddies."
1326,Elizabeth Warren,"I helped set up a special office at the @CFPB to protect servicemembers, who are often targets of scams. Now @MickMulvaneyOMB is siding with predatory lenders over our military. It’s a shameful disservice to people who put their lives on the line for us."
1327,Elizabeth Warren,"Shady #4profit colleges scam students out of their futures, &amp; @BetsyDeVosED is their biggest accomplice. She just issued a new rule that would ensure for-profits face NO consequences for graduating students with huge debts &amp; no job prospects. Another big favor for industry hacks."
1328,Elizabeth Warren,"I met with local officials and first responders yesterday from Webster &amp; Dudley to thank them for their work, and to talk about how we can get these towns back up and running after last week's tornado. Massachusetts is strong – and we’ll get through this by working together."
1329,Elizabeth Warren,"Mae was born with a serious lung disease that required a long hospitalization and a double transplant. Now, she and her family are working to protect Medicaid so kids like her have access to affordable care. I'm so proud to be in this fight with you, Mae."
1330,Elizabeth Warren,"After I asked @CommerceGov about their decision to grant tariff exemptions worth millions to a sanctioned Russian company, they suddenly reversed it. Begging the question – is @realDonaldTrump trying to help the US aluminum industry, or his pal Putin?"
1331,Elizabeth Warren,My office found that Rusal America Corp – a subsidiary of a sanctioned company controlled by a Russian oligarch &amp; Putin ally – got an exemption from @realDonaldTrump’s aluminum tariffs days after he met with Putin in Helsinki. I asked the Trump Admin why.
1332,Elizabeth Warren,"Tragically, the death toll in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria is far higher than the official count. The federal gov't hasn't done enough to assist or force accountability. I’ve called for a bipartisan commission to investigate the Trump Admin’s response. https://t.co/zWTq84Z882"
1333,Elizabeth Warren,"Isata worked hard to provide for her family back in Sierra Leone. She was fired – supposedly for asking for tips – after trying to organize a union. The rich &amp; powerful seize every chance to crush working Americans with no accountability, while people like Isata pay the price."
1334,Elizabeth Warren,Massachusetts has the lowest rate of gun deaths in the county &amp; can serve as a model for the federal gov't to develop policies to keep schools safe. @RepKClark &amp; I surveyed MA educators &amp; have a series of recommendations for @BetsyDeVosED to help stop gun violence in schools.
1335,Elizabeth Warren,"Wilbur Ross is a cartoon stereotype of a Wall Street fat cat with no interest in anyone but himself. He has shady ties to Russia and China, serious business conflicts, and a history of cheating people out of their homes. What else is @SecretaryRoss hiding?"
1336,Elizabeth Warren,"Because of an error @WellsFargo made, 400 of its customers lost their homes. What’s the bank doing to make it right? Setting aside a few thousand dollars for each of the people affected. Pathetic. The execs who oversaw this – including CEO Tim Sloan – should be fired."
1337,Elizabeth Warren,"The Trump Admin's new tax form fits on a postcard –&amp; still requires 6 additional forms. It won’t save you time or money. To make Tax Day easier &amp; cheaper, Congress should pass my bill to let millions of Americans simply sign &amp; return a pre-filled tax form."
1338,Elizabeth Warren,Powerful corporate interests have poured gigantic amounts of money into capturing our courts – and the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh is their reward. We need to #StopKavanaugh so Washington starts working for the people again.
1339,Elizabeth Warren,Working families trying to save up for a better future lose billions of dollars a year because some brokers look out for their own financial interests instead of their clients’. The @SEC_News should take much stronger action to address this problem.
1340,Elizabeth Warren,I’m calling for an investigation into whether @realDonaldTrump used tours of Air Force One as a perk for Mar-a-Lago club members. The American people deserve better than a president who uses taxpayer-funded government resources to feather his own nest.
1341,Elizabeth Warren,"Just ten years after the big banks wrecked our economy, their lobbyists are gearing up for another round of rolling back important regulations - even though the banks are making record profits. The level of greed is astounding."
1342,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump couldn’t get the votes in Congress to sabotage health care – so he’s doing it all on his own. His new scheme will let insurers sell junk plans that charge people w/pre-existing conditions more &amp; jack up costs for everyone else.
1343,Elizabeth Warren,"A federal judge just forced @fema to extend shelter to Puerto Rican evacuees until August 31. That’s great for many families across MA– but now FEMA must help them find long-term solutions. If they don’t, we should pass my bill to force FEMA to do its job."
1344,Elizabeth Warren,Kathy Kraninger helped implement a policy to punish innocent young children – that is a moral stain that will follow her for the rest of her life. And that stain will follow any Senator who votes to give her a big promotion.
1345,Elizabeth Warren,Many kids are still separated and some of the kids who have been reunified aren't the same. One 5-year old boy asked his mom to breast feed him even though she hadn't nursed him in years. That's the legacy of the policy Kraninger helped carry out.
1346,Elizabeth Warren,"At OMB, Kraninger oversees the agencies that conducted child separations &amp; she admitted to me that @OMBPress “has an extensive role” in managing immigration policy. A former official said it would be “shocking” if she wasn’t involved in child separations."
1347,Elizabeth Warren,"The Banking Cmte might vote tmrw on Kathy Kraninger’s nomination to head @CFPB. She has no experience fighting for consumers, but part of her current job was to help @realDonaldTrump tear kids away from their parents at the border. Will Republicans reward her w/a big promotion?"
1348,Elizabeth Warren,I have a bill w/@RepCummings to combat the opioid crisis. The drug industry’s made billions in profits while pushing addictive medications &amp; turning a blind eye to the consequences. Our bill holds CEOs at companies that fuel the epidemic accountable for their actions.
1349,Elizabeth Warren,We know 3D-printed guns are dangerous - we don’t need to wait for the NRA to give Republicans its blessing. Glad to see MA leading the fight to keep these untraceable weapons off our streets.
1350,Elizabeth Warren,"Average wages are flat since the Republicans passed their tax bill, but big business CEOs are raking in record-breaking multi-million dollar bonuses. This was a policy designed to help the rich get richer – and it’s working just as Republicans planned."
1351,Elizabeth Warren,".@fred_guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was killed at Stoneman Douglas HS, is deeply concerned about 3D-printed plastic guns. Will Republicans have the courage to take action now before these guns flood the market?"
1352,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump wants to go around Congress &amp; hand $100 billion to his rich buddies on top of $1.5 trillion he gave away to billionaires &amp; big corporations last year. DC works great if you’re rich &amp; powerful. How about a gov't that works for everyone?
1353,Elizabeth Warren,Congressman Ron Dellums was a progressive champion who fought for civil rights and for a government that works for the people. My deepest sympathies are with his family and loved ones.
1354,Elizabeth Warren,"I visited Puerto Rico in January &amp; saw devastation. But the island was already being crushed by debt. As I said 6 months ago: PR needs help rebuilding, &amp; that help must go to those who need it. That's why I have a new bill to provide a path to debt relief."
1355,Elizabeth Warren,Too many women and girls who suffer from crippling endometriosis are told it’s all in their head. It's not. It's a serious health condition. We need to talk about it. We need to raise awareness and remove the stigma. We need to work together to study it &amp; find a cure.
1356,Elizabeth Warren,".@BetsyDeVosED and her team of #4profit college hacks are tearing down protections for students and taxpayers left and right so these garbage dump school executives can line their own pockets. This is corruption, plain and simple."
1357,Elizabeth Warren,We can’t defeat the opioid crisis with empty words and half measures. I was with @RepCummings in Baltimore today to discuss our plan to provide $100 billion to beat the opioid epidemic the same way we tackled the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
1358,Elizabeth Warren,"I spent over 30 yrs teaching &amp; studying markets, contracts, &amp; bankruptcy. Figuring out how to level the playing field for working families has been my life's work. Glad to answer Qs from @JRubinBlogger about how I see America's biggest economic"
1359,Elizabeth Warren,Today is the day the courts set for reunifying the families ripped apart by @realDonaldTrump’s administration. They still haven’t fixed the problem they created. The incompetence and inhumanity of this administration is staggering.
1360,Elizabeth Warren,"Four district courts and three courts of appeal have blocked @realDonaldTrump’s effort to ban transgender people from serving in our military. One year later, his ban is still discriminatory, unconstitutional, and doesn’t make America safer. #ProtectTransTroops"
1361,Elizabeth Warren,I stand with federal workers in Massachusetts and across the country. We’re wearing #RedForFeds today to protest @realDonaldTrump’s executive orders rolling back federal workers' rights.
1362,Elizabeth Warren,"Puerto Rico is trying to rebuild after Hurricane Maria, but it's being crushed by debt. @SenSanders &amp; I have a new bill to give territories that have suffered a major crisis a route to comprehensive debt relief and a chance to get back on their feet."
1363,Elizabeth Warren,"Betsy DeVos just proposed a ‘policy’ that will devastate students cheated by sham for-profit colleges, making it nearly impossible to have a fraudulent loan cancelled. @BetsyDeVosEd is supposed to work for students, not for-profit shareholders. Revolting."
1364,Elizabeth Warren,"If Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court, he will help overturn Roe v. Wade. We can’t go back to the time of back alley abortions. It’s time for women (and friends of women) to raise their voices and help #StopKavanaugh."
1365,Elizabeth Warren,"Brett Kavanaugh was handpicked by right-wing billionaires to tilt the scales of justice in their favor. I'm joining @RevDrBarber &amp; faith leaders to discuss how the rights of women, people of color, workers, LGBTQ Americans, &amp; the poor will be at risk if we don't #StopKavanaugh."
1366,Elizabeth Warren,"10 years after the financial crisis, lobbyists are flooding Congress &amp; saying it’s safe to roll back the rules on big banks again. They're wrong. Tune in as I talk with @RealBankReform about why we need a stable financial system that works for everyone."
1367,Elizabeth Warren,Wages stay flat as rents rise. Parents struggle to put food on the table. Kids drink water laced with lead. Working people are under attack. I joined @UniteThePoor for a conversation about how we can fight to reclaim our government from the rich &amp;
1368,Elizabeth Warren,".@WellsFargo built its business around deceiving customers. A fancy PR campaign &amp; expensive commercials won’t cut it – there needs to be real accountability. That starts by getting rid of current CEO, Tim Sloan, &amp; all the execs who were in charge while these scams took place."
1369,Elizabeth Warren,"The @CFPB was set up 7 years ago today to help consumers – and that’s exactly what happened. It’s returned $12 billion to Americans who have been cheated. But it’s being attacked by @realDonaldTrump, @MickMulvaneyOMB and their cronies. Here’s why the @CFPB is worth fighting for:"
1370,Elizabeth Warren,"Average wages are down since the beginning of the year, while the costs of health care, housing, and child care continue to rise. Most people have to work harder and longer just to get by. Our economy should work for everyone – not just the rich and powerful."
1371,Elizabeth Warren,"If a servicemember makes the ultimate sacrifice, we owe it to them to support their family. That's why I'm introducing this companion bill to provide Gold Star spouses with financial relief by allowing them to terminate a residential lease without penalty. https://t.co/WzhlQoLK8y"
1372,Elizabeth Warren,"Kathy Kraninger has no experience in consumer protection – her background is in drafting budgets. She previously proposed a 23% cut to the @CFPB’s budget, but today couldn't say how she'd do it. Budget cuts will hurt Americans who get cheated – they deserve answers, not dodges."
1373,Elizabeth Warren,"Innocent kids have been traumatized by the Trump Admin’s family separations. Kathy Kraninger played a role in that policy, but won't tell us what she did. And she refuses to say whether the policy is immoral.#FamiliesBelongTogether. Kraninger doesn't belong at the @CFPB."
1374,Elizabeth Warren,Kathy Kraninger – Trump’s nominee to run the @CFPB – is about to testify in front of @SenateBanking. She’ll face tough questions about her current job overseeing federal agencies that implemented the Trump Admin’s cruel child separation policy. Watch live:
1375,Elizabeth Warren,"Trump and his allies have attacked Special Counsel Mueller, the integrity of his investigation, and our own intelligence community. They should listen to William Webster – who directed the FBI &amp; CIA under President Reagan – and let Mueller do his job."
1376,Elizabeth Warren,".@Novartis is trying to score publicity points by holding off on raising drug prices for 5 &amp; a half months. But nothing is stopping them from jacking up prices again, because @realDonaldTrump still hasn’t taken any concrete action to lower costs. This is just another PR stunt."
1377,Elizabeth Warren,Every Democrat on @SenateBanking has called on Chairman Crapo to postpone @CFPB nominee Kathy Kraninger’s confirmation hearing until she hands over important documents that will help us conduct proper oversight of her nomination.
1378,Elizabeth Warren,Kathy Kraninger has zero experience that qualifies her to run the @CFPB. My new report details her career “highlights” – including oversight of agencies responsible for the Trump Admin's child separation policy &amp; botched recovery efforts in Puerto Rico.
1379,Elizabeth Warren,Every American who believes that our courts shouldn’t work only for the rich and powerful should speak out against Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination. And every senator who believes in equal justice under the law should vote to #StopKavanaugh:
1380,Elizabeth Warren,"Big banks are required to take annual stress tests to make sure they aren’t at risk of crashing our economy again. Today, I asked @FederalReserve Chair Powell why the Fed looked the other way when 3 banks failed the test:"
1381,Elizabeth Warren,I went to a border protection processing center 3 weeks ago – what I saw there was heartbreaking. We cannot lose sight of the fact that thousands of families are STILL separated due to @realDonaldTrump’s cruel immigration policy. We’ll keep fighting until they’re all reunited.
1382,Elizabeth Warren,"Americans in both parties were ashamed by @realDonaldTrump’s performance with Putin today – and carefully worded statements won’t repair the damage. It’s time for Republicans to join Democratic efforts to defend our elections, enforce sanctions, &amp; protect Mueller's investigation."
1383,Elizabeth Warren,"Once again, @realDonaldTrump takes to the international stage to embarrass America, undermine our institutions, weaken our alliances, &amp; embrace a dictator. Russia interfered in our elections &amp; attacked our democracy. Putin must be held accountable – not rewarded. Disgraceful."
1384,Elizabeth Warren,"My heart goes out to the family and friends of Officer Michael Chesna, a military veteran, of @WeymouthPD who was killed in the line of duty today. We are with you, Weymouth."
1385,Elizabeth Warren,My new investigation found that @realdonaldtrump’s lawyer Michael Cohen raked in millions selling access to the White House while secretly representing a drug company linked to a Russian oligarch. This stinks of corruption &amp; raises more questions about Cohen’s shady foreign ties.
1386,Elizabeth Warren,"DOJ's criminal charges provide hard evidence that Russian intel agents attacked America to boost their favorite candidates, undermine others, and influence our elections. @realDonaldTrump, cancel your ridiculous Putin summit and get your butt on a plane back to the United States."
1387,Elizabeth Warren,"I pushed hard for Congress to pass the Firefighter Cancer Registry Act, and it was signed into law this week. These firefighters explain why it’s important to them, and how it can help save lives:"
1388,Elizabeth Warren,"Workers should have a shot at better jobs and higher wages, but “no-poach” clauses rig the system to prevent that from happening. I’ve been working with @SenBooker to put a stop to it – &amp; today 7 fast food chains did the right thing &amp; ended the practice."
1389,Elizabeth Warren,Student loan debt affects millions of Americans – but it hits people of color harder than most. @SenKamalaHarris &amp; I are calling on @BetsyDeVosED to address the specific challenges communities of color face. We can’t allow student debt to lock black families out of opportunity.
1390,Elizabeth Warren,"When I went to the border, I saw for myself that the Trump Admin had no plan to reunite the families they ripped apart. Two weeks later, families are still separated because of their complete incompetence. This Admin needs to be held accountable for what they've done."
1391,Elizabeth Warren,Wishing a happy birthday to my friend @SenMarkey. There’s no one else I’d rather fight alongside for Massachusetts families.
1392,Elizabeth Warren,"Over 1/4 of Americans taking prescription drugs have trouble affording them. To bring costs down, we need new laws – not @realDonaldTrump photo-ops. My new bill would place a $500 monthly cap on what families have to pay out-of-pocket for prescriptions."
1393,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump still wants you to think drug companies will stop scamming Americans just because he asked. Gimme a break – @pfizer's delay of a price INCREASE is another meaningless stunt that won’t reduce costs for struggling families.
1394,Elizabeth Warren,America is strongest when we work together with our allies – including the 28 NATO members who share our democratic values. Undermining NATO is a gift to Putin that @realDonaldTrump seems all too happy to give.
1395,Elizabeth Warren,"Brett Kavanaugh opposed a ruling that upheld the ACA. If confirmed to the Supreme Court, he could vote to strike down protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Health care for millions of Americans: that’s #WhatsAtStake."
1396,Elizabeth Warren,UPDATE: The Firefighter Cancer Registry Act was signed into law yesterday. #BostonsBravest and firefighters across the country put their lives on the line for us every day – we owe it to them to do everything we can to protect their health and safety.
1397,Elizabeth Warren,There’s a lot to dislike about Brett Kavanaugh’s record – including his hostility toward consumers. He argued that the @CFPB – which has returned $12 billion to people who were cheated – is unconstitutional. The rights of consumers: that's #WhatsAtStake.
1398,Elizabeth Warren,Trump wants to put Brett Kavanaugh on the SCOTUS –but he can’t do it without a Senate majority. It’s time to fight:
1399,Elizabeth Warren,"Brett Kavanaugh's record as a judge and lawyer is clear: hostile to health care for millions, opposed to the CFPB &amp; corporate accountability, thinks Presidents like Trump are above the law – and conservatives are confident that he would overturn Roe v. Wade. I'll be voting no."
1400,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump, we need real policies to prevent drug companies from jacking up costs – like letting Medicare negotiate prices. You supported that during your campaign, then abandoned it after Big Pharma objected. Prescription drugs are too expensive, and your talk is cheap."
1401,Elizabeth Warren,"Every single judge on @realDonaldTrump’s short list for the Supreme Court has been pre-approved by right-wing extremists. They've shown their willingness to side with the wealthy &amp; powerful over the rights of women, workers, voters, &amp; minorities. But we're ready to fight back."
1402,Elizabeth Warren,"The Trump Administration ripped hundreds of children away from their parents long before announcing the ""zero-tolerance"" policy. Reuniting these families is just the first step in rebuilding an immigration system that reflects our values."
1403,Elizabeth Warren,I'm back in Massachusetts after spending some time on the ground with our troops in Iraq and Kuwait. Our deployed military personnel put their lives on the line every day. I'm grateful to have celebrated Independence Day with them.
1404,Elizabeth Warren,Andrew Wheeler may not have the same stink of blatant corruption as @EPAScottPruitt – but he’s just as dirty. The @EPA's new Acting Director is a former coal lobbyist who will work to poison the agency – and the environment he’s supposed to protect – from the inside.
1405,Elizabeth Warren,"It looks like 29 was the magic number. @EPAScottPruitt has finally resigned. The American people deserve a new EPA chief who’s focused on protecting our environment, instead of someone intent on doing the bidding of Big Oil donors while wasting taxpayer dollars."
1406,Elizabeth Warren,"Climate change denier @EPAScottPruitt has become the poster boy for corruption in Washington – repeatedly using his government office to benefit himself, his family, and his Big Oil buddies. He should have resigned 28 scandals ago."
1407,Elizabeth Warren,I’m grateful to each of our servicemembers for the sacrifices they make to keep our country safe. And I’m honored to have celebrated this Independence Day with these brave men and women.
1408,Elizabeth Warren,Our military support played a significant role in enabling the Iraqi Security Forces to retake their country – but only the Iraqis can do the hard work needed to rebuild and prevent extremist threats from reemerging. They need the world's support in this effort.
1409,Elizabeth Warren,"I met with Iraqi Prime Minister al-Abadi. We discussed Iraq's recent elections, our countries’ joint commitment to defeating ISIS and combating terrorism in the region, and our shared desire to build a better life for the Iraqi people."
1410,Elizabeth Warren,I met with Ambassador Silliman and several Foreign Service Officers at the US embassy in Baghdad. Our diplomats abroad are our eyes and ears on the ground in some of the world's most challenging places – and they often put their lives on the line as well.
1411,Elizabeth Warren,"I joined @LindseyGrahamSC in Iraq for a tour of Mosul. The city was controlled by ISIS until a year ago, when Iraqi Security Forces liberated it with US support. Much of the city is still in ruins, but the Iraqis are working hard to rebuild."
1412,Elizabeth Warren,"This July 4th, I’m on my way back to Massachusetts from Iraq and Kuwait, where I visited with our troops on the ground – including soldiers from the Massachusetts Army National Guard. Our men and women in uniform are truly extraordinary."
1413,Elizabeth Warren,The Ryan White CARE Act transformed how we treat HIV/AIDS. @RepCummings &amp; I have proposed a similar approach to beat the opioid crisis by investing $100B in treatment &amp; research. Every member of @HouseDems leadership supports it. It's time for the GOP to step up &amp; pass our bill.
1414,Elizabeth Warren,"Unions built America’s middle class, &amp; unions will rebuild it. This weekend, I joined union workers and their families on the picket line outside @nationalgridus. They’re fighting for better wages &amp; health care coverage. @Steelworkers don’t back down – I’m with them all the way."
1415,Elizabeth Warren,"When I went down to the border to see what was happening, I met with advocates who are doing everything they can to #KeepFamiliesTogether. They've been working overtime on this, and they know we can't stop until every single child is reunited with their family."
1416,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump’s short list of Supreme Court nominees was hand-picked by right-wing extremists who want to criminalize abortions and punish women who have them. Roe v. Wade. That’s #WhatsAtStake here.
1417,Elizabeth Warren,"At the #FamiliesBelongTogether march tomorrow, we’ll show @realDonaldTrump that the real power is with the people. I’ll be rallying in Boston. Will you join us? #TogetherAndFree"
1418,Elizabeth Warren,"Tomorrow, thousands of Puerto Rican evacuees will lose federal housing assistance &amp; many will be left homeless. @FEMA refuses to set up the longer-term disaster housing program used after Katrina &amp; Sandy. And the GOP is blocking legislation that would do it. This is shameful."
1419,Elizabeth Warren,"Great news: Massachusetts is moving closer to a level playing field for working families. Congratulations to @RaiseUPMA and the thousands of workers, organizers, and volunteers who have fought their hearts out for an MA economy that works for everyone!"
1420,Elizabeth Warren,My heart goes out to the Capital Gazette. No journalist should have to duck bullets in the newsroom. No student should have to hide from an active shooter. No one should have to live in fear of being in the middle of the next mass shooting. This violence MUST end.
1421,Elizabeth Warren,".@nationalgridus got a huge windfall from the #GOPtaxscam – but the gas company is still squeezing its own employees. 1,100 union workers who were negotiating for better wages &amp; health care coverage have been locked out of their jobs. @steelworkers, we’re with you in this fight."
1422,Elizabeth Warren,The fight for equal justice for ALL Americans – not just the rich and powerful – has only just begun. Watch live:
1423,Elizabeth Warren,Mitch McConnell should follow the Mitch McConnell rule. Let the American people have a say when women’s health and equal rights are on the line.
1424,Elizabeth Warren,Corporate interests have been rigging the system against workers for decades – and the Supreme Court just handed those interests a huge victory in #Janus v. AFSCME. But I’ve got news for the billionaires behind this case: we’re not going anywhere. #Union
1425,Elizabeth Warren,"I went down to the border protection processing center in McAllen, Texas so I could see what’s happening there with my own eyes. They wouldn’t let cameras inside, but I can tell you what I saw:"
1426,Elizabeth Warren,"The Supreme Court – thanks to a seat stolen by right-wing Republicans – just upheld Trump’s Muslim ban. While the Court ruled it’s legal, the American people still know it isn’t right. And together, we'll keep fighting against religious discrimination, xenophobia, &amp; hate. (2/2)"
1427,Elizabeth Warren,"Last year, I joined hundreds of people at Logan Airport to protest @realDonaldTrump's Muslim ban. We believed that the courts would ultimately overturn it – because it didn’t make us any safer, and it clearly violated America’s core values. We were wrong. (1/2)"
1428,Elizabeth Warren,"I believe that when a woman flees the only home she's ever known with her 4-year-old son and begs the United States of America for asylum, she deserves a fair hearing. I believe that every human being has worth. We must do better."
1429,Elizabeth Warren,"I spoke with one woman from El Salvador at a CBP processing center. She  gave a policeman a drink of water, and the gangs came after her. She sold everything she had and fled with her 4-year-old son because their lives were in danger."
1430,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, I'm in McAllen, TX. What I've witnessed here is truly disturbing. People are being held in cages – there's no other way to describe it. There are children by themselves. Mothers with young babies. They have nothing but the clothes on their backs"
1431,Elizabeth Warren,"By outlawing marijuana, the federal government puts communities of color, small businesses, and public health and safety at risk. I talked with @Chris_topher_Mc of @WBSM1420 about my bipartisan bill to end the federal ban on marijuana."
1432,Elizabeth Warren,Powerful corporations and their Republican allies are working overtime to roll back basic rules that protect working Americans. Why? The answer’s pretty simple. It's the culture of corruption in Washington.
1433,Elizabeth Warren,"It's been 6 months since Trump signed the #GOPtaxscam into law. I spoke with @KellerAtLarge about how it's hurting working families – and why we need a government that works for everyone, not just billionaires and big corporations."
1434,Elizabeth Warren,"UPDATE: @BetsyDeVosED has lost another round in federal court. A judge just ruled that she cannot collect loans from students defrauded by Corinthian College, a predatory for-profit. This is a big win for students who have been scammed. https://t.co/vDuQmZ4JQZ"
1435,Elizabeth Warren,"If you agree that Thomas Farr – who has defended discrimination &amp; worked to restrict the voting rights of African Americans – has no place as a federal judge, now’s the time to say it loud and clear. @SenateMajLdr McConnell wants to ram through his confirmation in the Senate."
1436,Elizabeth Warren,This isn’t over. Thousands of kids have been ripped from their parents with no plan to reunite them. And now @realdonaldtrump wants to create new detention camps for families. Separating kids is unacceptable – but indefinite imprisonment of families is still cruel &amp; inhumane.
1437,Elizabeth Warren,"On #WorldRefugeeDay, we cannot ignore the humanitarian crisis happening on our border as desperate families flee violence &amp; persecution. We should treat those seeking refuge with fairness &amp; compassion. We should be helping to solve the global refugee crisis – not making it worse."
1438,Elizabeth Warren,.@RepCummings has devoted his life to the fight for justice. Watch as he makes a powerful case for why #FamiliesBelongTogether:
1439,Elizabeth Warren,@realDonaldTrump is meeting with House Republicans to discuss his immigration crisis. Will they have the courage to stand against his family separation policy?
1440,Elizabeth Warren,Kathy Kraninger helps oversee the agencies that are ripping kids from their parents. Now @realDonaldTrump wants her to run the @CFPB. I will put a hold on her nomination – &amp; fight it at every step – until she turns over all documents about her role in this.#FamiliesBelongTogether
1441,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump’s nominee to run the @CFPB, Kathy Kraninger, has no track record of helping consumers. That's bad news for seniors, servicemembers, students – and anyone else who doesn't want to get cheated. And it gets even worse."
1442,Elizabeth Warren,".@realdonaldtrump could pick up the phone and stop the separation of families seeking refuge in the US. Instead, he continues to hold thousands of kids hostage to try and get Congress to pay for his stupid wall. This is his policy, and he can stop it. #FamiliesBelongTogether"
1443,Elizabeth Warren,Kids across the US are spending today with their dads. But thousands of children who have been separated from their parents by the Trump Admin don’t have that option. Make this a #FathersDayOfAction &amp; join our fight to reunite these families. Ask your senators to support S.3036.
1444,Elizabeth Warren,"Thousands of Americans have joined @UniteThePoor to call on our government to pay attention: to flat wages and rising rents, to undrinkable water, to families who struggle to put food on the table. @RepRoKhanna and I are listening, and we're in this fight all the way."
1445,Elizabeth Warren,Joseph Otting told Congress he’s never seen discrimination – even though he used to run a bank that went out of its way not to serve black and Latino families. Now he's in charge of rewriting bank anti-discrimination rules. Absurd. #OCCnoColor
1446,Elizabeth Warren,My colleague @RepJayapal is right. We are not talking about immigration policy. We are talking about the soul of America. That is what’s at stake. #FamiliesBelongTogether
1447,Elizabeth Warren,I’m going to fight like hell with @SenatorDurbin and the @SenateDems to end this cruel Trump Administration policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether
1448,Elizabeth Warren,The official policy of this administration is to rip children from their parents. Let that sink in. And then fight back. #FamiliesBelongTogether
1449,Elizabeth Warren,Children are being separated from their parents and incarcerated. It’s not enough to be outraged. Make your voice heard and help us put a stop to this. #FamiliesBelongTogether
1450,Elizabeth Warren,"We don't know how many Puerto Ricans died from Hurricane Maria, but we do know the official death toll of 64 is a huge undercount. The federal government hasn't done enough to assist or force accountability. I led 21 colleagues in demanding answers."
1451,Elizabeth Warren,"The Trump Admin is packing our courts with right-wing nominees like Chad Readler who want to tilt the scales in favor of the rich &amp; powerful &amp; against everyone else. Anyone who cares about protecting the rights of all Americans should be in the fight for fair, impartial nominees."
1452,Elizabeth Warren,Some state governments are punishing people struggling with student loans by taking away their drivers’ &amp; professional licenses. This is wrong. @marcorubio &amp; I have a new bill to ensure borrowers can keep working to pay off their debt &amp; build a future.
1453,Elizabeth Warren,"Power is more and more concentrated in a handful of giant companies at the expense of small businesses, entrepreneurs, and working families. The @TheJusticeDept should appeal the court decision allowing the merger of @ATT and @twxcorp."
1454,Elizabeth Warren,Thousands of children have been torn from their parents’ arms because of @realdonaldtrump’s cruel immigration policies – and now he wants to put them in prison camps. Their only “crime”? Seeking refuge here in the US. This is immoral. This is un-American. This is not who we are.
1455,Elizabeth Warren,"Congress is voting on a reckless provision jammed into this year’s defense bill that would give @realdonaldtrump free rein to develop new nuclear weapons without congressional approval. @SenJackReed, @SenateDems and I are fighting hard to remove it."
1456,Elizabeth Warren,".@SecAzar told the Senate about his shiny new drug pricing plan yesterday. But he can’t guarantee it won't raise prices for seniors on Medicare. And those ""massive"" price cuts Trump promised? Nowhere to be seen. Our seniors deserve real action to bring down high drug prices."
1457,Elizabeth Warren,Poor &amp; marginalized Americans are coming together across the country to demand a government that works for the people. Tune in live as @RepCummings and I welcome @UniteThePoor to the Capitol for a powerfully important conversation on poverty in America:
1458,Elizabeth Warren,My full statement on President Trump’s meeting with Kim Jong Un: https://t.co/BgyTMzhI4q
1459,Elizabeth Warren,"Jeff Sessions' move to deny asylum to women fleeing domestic violence does not reflect our country's true values. These strong, brave women come to America in search of safety and freedom. We should welcome them with compassion – not slam the door in their faces."
1460,Elizabeth Warren,"Red &amp; blue states alike have taken their own thoughtful approaches to marijuana. Now, 12 governors – led by @MassGovernor Baker – have endorsed my bipartisan bill to end the confusion between states &amp; the federal gov't, &amp; fix our broken marijuana policy."
1461,Elizabeth Warren,Our democracy is under attack – but not lost. Watch live as I talk with the @ACLU about how we’re fighting to save it:
1462,Elizabeth Warren,The Supreme Court’s decision to make it easier for Ohio to cross eligible voters off the rolls is a major step backwards for our democracy. Americans should demand that Congress – and the courts – protect the voting rights of all citizens.
1463,Elizabeth Warren,"By outlawing marijuana, the federal government puts communities of color, small businesses, public health &amp; safety at risk. @SenCoryGardner and I have a new bill to end the federal ban on marijuana, and let states take their own approaches:"
1464,Elizabeth Warren,"When I questioned Trump's pick to be the head of civil rights at @usedgov, he dipped &amp; dodged on whether he'd protect our kids from discrimination. But Senate Republicans still voted to confirm him, so he can join @BetsyDeVosED's efforts to undermine students' civil rights."
1465,Elizabeth Warren,"Yesterday I met with Puerto Rican families who evacuated to MA after Hurricane Maria. They want to make MA their home, but are struggling to find long-term housing. @FEMA &amp; the Trump Admin have abandoned them – but @SenMarkey &amp; I will keep fighting for our fellow US citizens."
1466,Elizabeth Warren,"A majority of Americans support legalizing marijuana. It’s time for Congress to listen, and pass this new bipartisan legislation."
1467,Elizabeth Warren,There's a lot we can do to address America’s broken marijuana policies – like passing @SenBooker’s #MarijuanaJusticeAct to end the federal ban on marijuana &amp; retroactively fix some of the harms caused by it. My new bipartisan bill is another key step to update our marijuana laws.
1468,Elizabeth Warren,No qualified scientist should have to struggle to conduct basic research on marijuana. Their findings could spur medical advances or counter the opioid epidemic. I'm introducing a new bill with @SenCoryGardner that could make it easier to study marijuana’s medical uses.
1469,Elizabeth Warren,No legitimate business should be blocked from basic banking services – but that’s exactly what’s happening to law-abiding marijuana businesses. My new bipartisan bill will help decrease the public safety risk that arises when these businesses are forced to operate in all-cash.
1470,Elizabeth Warren,"No veteran with chronic pain, child with a rare disease, or person struggling with a terminal illness should be denied the treatment they need. Millions of Americans currently access medical marijuana under state law. My new bill with @SenCoryGardner will help protect them."
1471,Elizabeth Warren,No one should go to jail for a joint. But more Americans are arrested for marijuana possession than all violent crimes combined. And black Americans are nearly 4x more likely to be arrested for it than whites. My new bill will help put an end to this two-tiered justice system.
1472,Elizabeth Warren,"By outlawing marijuana, the federal government puts communities of color, small businesses, &amp; public health &amp; safety at risk. My new bill with @SenCoryGardner will let states, territories, &amp; tribes decide for themselves how to regulate marijuana – without federal interference."
1473,Elizabeth Warren,"The federal government’s marijuana policies are broken, outdated, and disregard the rights of states like MA &amp; CO that have taken their own thoughtful approaches. @SenCoryGardner and I are introducing new legislation to protect them."
1474,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s time to reform American’s outdated marijuana policies. Watch live as @SenCoryGarder and I discuss our new legislation that would let states, territories, &amp; tribes decide for themselves how best to regulate marijuana – without federal interference."
1475,Elizabeth Warren,.@MickMulvaneyOMB has no intention of putting consumers above financial firms that cheat them. This is what happens when you put someone in charge of an agency they think shouldn’t exist.
1476,Elizabeth Warren,"Robert Kennedy understood that we cannot simply run our economy for those at the top and assume that it will solve America’s problems. After his death, America tried that experiment anyway, and failed miserably. It's time to try something different."
1477,Elizabeth Warren,"Corruption oozes out of @EPAScottPruitt’s office like toxic sludge – and working families will get burned by it. I spoke today about why we must clean up the corporate money sloshing around DC, and ensure our government represents real people – not Pruitt’s Big Coal buddies."
1478,Elizabeth Warren,"The GOP wants you to believe that their war on regulations is about freedom. Baloney. Good rules empower people to live, work, and do business freely and safely. Tune in live as I speak about how strong, clear rules protect the freedom of all Americans."
1479,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump is playing a political game, and he believes he gets to make up the rules. He doesn’t. The Constitution is clear – even the President of the United States is not above the law. Special Counsel Mueller must continue his investigation without interference."
1480,Elizabeth Warren,La respuesta del gobierno federal en Puerto Rico después del huracán María ha sido pésima. Hablé con @TelemundoNI sobre un nuevo proyecto de ley que tengo con el @SenMarkey para finalmente ayudar a los sobrevivientes que han venido a Massachusetts a encontrar nuevos hogares.
1481,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenMarkey &amp; I are introducing a bill to make @FEMA address the medium &amp; long-term housing needs of survivors of Hurricane Maria &amp; future natural disasters. Families are at risk of homelessness &amp; a new hurricane season is about to begin – this can’t wait.
1482,Elizabeth Warren,Let’s be clear: @realDonaldTrump's gag rule isn't about improving women’s health care. It's an attempt to control women and shut down Title X providers that offer critical reproductive care. It’s right-wing ideology disguised as health policy.
1483,Elizabeth Warren,Car dealers are exempt from @CFPB oversight – and auto loan defaults just hit a 15-year high. That's not a coincidence. It's what happens when shady lending practices go unchecked.
1484,Elizabeth Warren,"Even as banks make record profits, their former banker buddies turned regulators are doing them favors by rolling back a rule that protects taxpayers from another bailout. This kind of corruption is common in @realDonaldTrump’s Washington."
1485,Elizabeth Warren,"Thousands of students were cheated by for-profit colleges, but @BetsyDeVosED wants to stop students from getting the full loan forgiveness they deserve. So, I called for an investigation. Now a federal judge has agreed with me &amp; stopped her illegal scheme."
1486,Elizabeth Warren,".@Walmart rakes in billions from the #GOPTaxScam and sends the profits straight to Wall Street, while many employees struggle to put food on the dinner table. These share buybacks are a perfect example of how our economy is rigged against working families."
1487,Elizabeth Warren,"In another example of weak enforcement that will harm our economy, the DOJ just approved the @Bayer-@MonsantoCo merger, placing enormous power in the hands of one agribusiness giant. This deal is a brutal blow to small &amp; family farmers, as well as our food supply."
1488,Elizabeth Warren,"The official death count in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria is only 64. A new study shows the real total could be 70x that. For months, I've pushed for an accurate gov't count to learn the full extent of this tragedy. It's disgraceful we're still waiting. https://t.co/uDYGca05LG"
1489,Elizabeth Warren,"All 3 of my brothers served &amp; came home safe. But many do not. I had the chance to honor a special group of veterans by dedicating a new POW/MIA Chair of Honor in the Capitol. It reminds us of those who haven't returned. On #MemorialDay, we remember &amp; honor their sacrifice."
1490,Elizabeth Warren,Firefighters face a higher rate of cancer than the rest of the population. They face enough risk every day – we’ve got to do our part to keep them safe. Here’s what I’m doing in the Senate to help.
1491,Elizabeth Warren,"Update: Brian Montgomery has been confirmed by the Senate 74 to 23. In Donald Trump’s Washington, the revolving door spins faster and faster."
1492,Elizabeth Warren,The #BankLobbyistAct was just signed into law – rolling back rules on big banks. But bank lobbyists are already asking Congress for another round of favors. Washington won't stop this cycle until the American people demand
1493,Elizabeth Warren,"President Trump’s wild back and forth with Kim Jong Un shows once again that he has no strategy. If @realdonaldtrump wants to demonstrate real leadership, he needs to develop a plan and commit to work towards a peaceful resolution with North Korea."
1494,Elizabeth Warren,"I spoke with preachers from across the country about growing up a Methodist, teaching Sunday School to rowdy 5th graders, &amp; why I’m determined to fight for respect for the value of every person. Thank you, @FestHomiletics, for hosting – and for joining in these righteous fights."
1495,Elizabeth Warren,"I love when the USW comes to the Capitol. They’re loud, they’re strong, and they won’t back down from the fight. Corporate interests have captured a Supreme Court seat and continue to haunt the halls of Congress, but I stand with @steelworkers and unions all the way!"
1496,Elizabeth Warren,"Over 700 children have been separated from their parents thanks to a new, cruel Trump Admin policy. Today, @SenateDems are calling on @realdonaldtrump &amp; @DHSgov to stop their attacks on asylum-seeking families. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/kLTpKkIKH9"
1497,Elizabeth Warren,"Yesterday, I met with @AMarch4OurLives leaders @Alfonso_Cal, @davidhogg111, and @Charlie_Mirsky. Congress still hasn’t found the courage to act on gun violence – but these students continue to bravely lead the fight. I’m proud to stand with them."
1498,Elizabeth Warren,"We should be expanding – not limiting – women’s access to reproductive health care. Instead, the GOP is attacking services that prevent unplanned pregnancies, women's access to STI &amp; cancer screenings, &amp; their right to make their own reproductive choices."
1499,Elizabeth Warren,"Big banks have spent millions of dollars trying to roll back the rules we put in place after we bailed them out ten years ago. Today, they got what they paid for. The House just passed the #BankLobbyistAct. We lost this round – but we won't give up the fight."
1500,Elizabeth Warren,"In a decision written by Justice Gorsuch, the Supreme Court has ruled that corporations can block workers from suing together over major violations of their rights, like sexual harassment, discrimination, &amp; wage theft. Congress should act to reverse this terrible decision."
1501,Elizabeth Warren,"For years, armies of bank lobbyists &amp; executives have groaned about how financial rules are hurting them. But there's a big problem with their story – banks are making record profits. Congress has done enough favors for big banks – the House should reject the #BankLobbyistAct."
1502,Elizabeth Warren,The #BankLobbyistAct rolls back the rules on big banks &amp; increases the risk of another taxpayer bailout. It could pass the House tomorrow. This is our last chance to stop this bill from becoming law. Washington has heard enough from the lobbyists – it's time they hear from you.
1503,Elizabeth Warren,I graduated from a commuter college like @Quinsig. Even as the rich and powerful tighten their hold on our democratic institutions – democracy is changing. And I’m hopeful because the Class of 2018 and young people everywhere are leading the change.
1504,Elizabeth Warren,"Today I told the graduates of @lesley_u: There will be plenty of people in your life who will try to shut you up, but people who shut up seldom make a difference. #persist"
1505,Elizabeth Warren,"My heart breaks for the students and faculty of Santa Fe High School, and the families of those who lost their lives today. One young person lost to gun violence is one too many. This cannot continue. #EnoughIsEnough"
1506,Elizabeth Warren,"We're going to keep fighting back against @realdonaldtrump, @VP Pence, and right-wing politicians who want to regulate women's bodies and shut down Planned Parenthood. Women's reproductive health care is health care. Period. #StandwithPP"
1507,Elizabeth Warren,.@realdonaldtrump's gag rule is designed to kick providers like Planned Parenthood out of Title X &amp; hold women hostage to the GOP's agenda. Title X patients won't be able to learn about all their reproductive options – worsening health care disparities &amp; reducing access to care.
1508,Elizabeth Warren,"Title X provides birth control, cancer screenings &amp; HIV tests to over 4M Americans. It doesn’t fund abortions &amp; never has. But today, @realdonaldtrump will issue a “gag” rule that will stop Title X doctors from even talking to their patients about abortion-related services."
1509,Elizabeth Warren,"Creating fake accounts, cheating servicemembers, overcharging mortgage borrowers – and now altering documents to fake compliance with an anti-money laundering order. @WellsFargo needs to face some real consequences, and CEO Tim Sloan needs to be fired."
1510,Elizabeth Warren,"No matter how you dress it up, torture is torture. It’s inhumane, ineffective, and un-American. Gina Haspel advocated for torture. Watch live as I call on my colleagues to reject her nomination for CIA Director:"
1511,Elizabeth Warren,I ran into 2018 @bostonmarathon champ @des_linden today. I’m glad she slowed down long enough for us to grab a photo.
1512,Elizabeth Warren,Thanks to my partner @SenMarkey for leading the charge in the Senate to save #NetNeutrality. We won this fight today because the American people made their voices heard – our colleagues in the House should listen.
1513,Elizabeth Warren,"Democrats want to stop internet providers from blocking access, filtering content, or charging higher fees. I’m speaking on the Senate floor ahead of a big vote to save #NetNeutrality. Tune in live – while you still can:"
1514,Elizabeth Warren,"CEO salaries are soaring while wages for American workers are barely budging. At many companies, CEOs make more in 1 year than their employees could make in a lifetime. @keithellison’s new report is a powerful tool for workers, shareholders, and the public to demand fair pay."
1515,Elizabeth Warren,".@Equifax faced no real penalty after compromising the data of 148M Americans. Instead of demanding accountability, the @FTC is putting the company's hired gun in charge of the bureau that’s supposed to protect consumers. This is corruption, plain &amp;"
1516,Elizabeth Warren,"Thomas Farr, @realdonaldtrump's nominee for a federal judgeship, worked to undermine voting rights &amp; defended discrimination against women, African Americans, &amp; LGBTQ Americans. His record should disqualify him from sitting on the bench, &amp; the Senate should reject his nomination."
1517,Elizabeth Warren,Both @ATT and @Novartis had significant business before the Trump Admin when they secretly paid Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen hundreds of thousands of dollars. What did they expect in return? Was this pay-to-play? The American people deserve to know.
1518,Elizabeth Warren,".@BetsyDeVosED has filled @usedgov with for-profit college hacks who only care about making sham schools rich and shutting down investigations into fraud. In the Trump Administration’s war on students, I stand with students."
1519,Elizabeth Warren,Hey @PhilipsLight: You don’t get to walk away with millions in tax breaks and then turn around and spit in the face of your workers. We won’t stop fighting for Fall River.
1520,Elizabeth Warren,Carl knows what it will take to beat the opioid epidemic – because he’s been fighting the AIDS epidemic for years. We need to invest in research and treatment. We need money to go directly to the communities that need it. We need to pass the #CAREact.
1521,Elizabeth Warren,I pushed the @federalreserve hard to hold a public vote on whether @WellsFargo should be allowed to get any bigger – and now they will. The Fed should strongly enforce the penalties it imposed to keep the bank from cheating people again.
1522,Elizabeth Warren,We owe our @USNationalGuard members the very best. But some officers are forced to wait months for their promotions to be recognized due to bureaucratic delays. My bipartisan bill with @SteveDaines takes simple steps to fix this &amp; do right by our Guard.
1523,Elizabeth Warren,It’s unacceptable that @Equifax has taken so long to tell the whole truth about the extent of the breach. @Equifax needs to be held accountable – and we need strong legislation to make sure credit reporting agencies don’t let this happen again.
1524,Elizabeth Warren,A months-long investigation by my office revealed that @Equifax failed to disclose all the information that was taken in the #EquifaxBreach. The company tried to deny it – but now admits that thousands of Americans’ passport numbers were exposed.
1525,Elizabeth Warren,I agree with @SenJohnMcCain. I opposed Gina Haspel’s nomination from the beginning – and I will vote against her confirmation.https://t.co/9DkFcfaXnw
1526,Elizabeth Warren,About to call into @BosPublicRadio to talk with @margeryeagan and @criticalthawt (in for @jimbraude). Tune in live at 11:35.
1527,Elizabeth Warren,"Student loan debt is exploding, but @MickMulvaneyOMB is planning to shut down the only federal office fully focused on protecting student borrowers from predatory companies. Add this to @BetsyDeVosED's anti-student work, &amp; it's clear the Trump Admin has declared war on students."
1528,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, Senate Democrats are moving to force a vote on @SenMarkey’s resolution to save #NetNeutrality. We only need #OneMoreVote to make sure the internet stays free and open for all. Now is the time to make your voice heard."
1529,Elizabeth Warren,"When I was in 2nd grade, Mrs. Lee told me that I too could be a teacher one day. I grew up to be a teacher, then a senator – in no small part because she made me feel like I could do anything. Teachers are teaching our future. They deserve our respect &amp; support. #ThankATeacher"
1530,Elizabeth Warren,"Our justice system is broken. Black and brown Americans receive harsher sentences than white Americans for the same crimes. @OfficialCBC, how can we work together to end racial bias in our justice system and ensure everyone is treated equally under the law? #CBCDemandsJustice"
1531,Elizabeth Warren,The @OfficialCBC is hosting a Twitter town hall right now on our broken criminal justice system. This is a powerfully important conversation – I  hope you’ll join me in participating. #CBCDemandsJustice
1532,Elizabeth Warren,Even the Trump Administration has conceded that Iran is complying with the deal. Now @realdonaldtrump has pulled out without offering any real alternative to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Creating chaos and confusion isn’t a strategy – it’s a recipe for disaster.
1533,Elizabeth Warren,"The Obama Administration negotiated a landmark agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. @realDonaldTrump’s decision to withdraw from the deal breaks our word, hurts our credibility with our allies, empowers Iranian hardliners, and doesn’t make us any safer."
1534,Elizabeth Warren,Massachusetts has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country – and one of the lowest gun fatality rates as a result. Congress should follow Massachusetts’ lead and put tougher gun laws in place at the federal level.
1535,Elizabeth Warren,Crystal Perry of the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe in MA loved horses &amp; her family. She &amp; a friend were murdered in 2013 – the case remains unsolved. We must pass @SenatorHeitkamp’s #SavannasAct to help end these violent crimes against Native women.#NotInvisible
1536,Elizabeth Warren,Today is National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls. Thousands of Native American women &amp; girls go missing or are murdered each year. These women are #NotInvisible. The plague of violence against Native women demands our attention &amp; federal action.
1537,Elizabeth Warren,"Last month, Bruce &amp; I visited the @NPG to see the stunning new portraits of the Obamas. @BarackObama's captures the vibrant hope he brought to even the toughest challenges. Conviction &amp; compassion radiate from @MichelleObama's. It's worth a special trip to see them for yourself."
1538,Elizabeth Warren,I hope President Trump’s negotiations with North Korea succeed – the world will be a safer place if they do. But the White House must engage Congress in the process to find a peaceful solution and prevent a nuclear crisis.
1539,Elizabeth Warren,Why are teachers paid so little? Why aren’t more politicians across state legislatures standing up for them? I’ll tell you why.
1540,Elizabeth Warren,"America is safer when our State Department is fully funded, well-staffed, and focused on diplomacy. Now that he's Secretary of State, I'll be watching @SecPompeo closely. He should listen to our military leaders and put diplomacy first – not his radical political agenda."
1541,Elizabeth Warren,"@PhilipsLight is hanging loyal, hard-working employees and the Fall River community out to dry. This is the real legacy of the @realdonaldtrump-GOP tax scam: American workers suffer so wealthy shareholders can get even richer. It's despicable."
1542,Elizabeth Warren,"Instead of buying back their own stock and outsourcing jobs, companies like @PhilipsLight should be investing in the workers and communities that made them so successful in the first place."
1543,Elizabeth Warren,".@PhilipsLight can afford to shell out $187 million to shareholders, so @RepJoeKennedy and I want to know why they’re planning to outsource nearly 200 jobs to Canada &amp; Mexico. One thing is clear: @realDonaldTrump’s #GOPtaxscam isn’t working for Fall River."
1544,Elizabeth Warren,Did you know it’s legal for companies to pay people with disabilities pennies on the dollar for doing the same job as a worker without a disability? It’s a discriminatory practice – and I'm working to eliminate it.
1545,Elizabeth Warren,"The proposed merger between Sprint and T-Mobile could strangle competition in the telecom industry and end up hurting small businesses, entrepreneurs, and working families. @TheJusticeDept and FCC need to give this deal a long, hard look."
1546,Elizabeth Warren,I agree with Sheriff @stevenwtompkins of Suffolk County – the opioid epidemic is out of control and our country needs to step up and get people the treatment they need.
1547,Elizabeth Warren,"Over 20,000 consumers have filed complaints about @Equifax with the @CFPB since the #EquifaxBreach. But instead of working to help those people, @MickMulvaneyOMB wants to make it easier for big financial institutions to get away with cheating them."
1548,Elizabeth Warren,"Firefighters are exposed to harsh chemicals on the job, and develop cancer at higher rates as a result. I've been pushing for a bipartisan bill to create a national cancer registry to collect better data so we can help protect our firefighters. Thanks to @Boston25 for covering."
1549,Elizabeth Warren,"Last month, corporate lobbyists found a single court willing to block @USDOL's conflict-of-interest rule, which was designed to stop shady advisers from cheating families out of billions every year. I'm glad that @AARP is sticking up for retirement"
1550,Elizabeth Warren,I’d like @MickMulvaneyOMB to explain to the American people why almost every major decision he’s made at the @CFPB has benefited the lobbyists who donated thousands of dollars to his political
1551,Elizabeth Warren,"The DOJ is on track to approve a merger between Monsanto and Bayer, which would hand control of 1/4 of the world’s seeds and pesticides to a single mega-giant company. This is a bad deal that would put the squeeze on struggling family farmers &amp; jeopardize our food supply."
1552,Elizabeth Warren,"Our military leaders have told us – many times – that a strong State Department is critical to their mission. Now that Mike Pompeo has been confirmed to serve as America’s top diplomat, I hope he’ll follow their advice and put diplomacy first."
1553,Elizabeth Warren,Favorite meeting of the day. #TakeYourChildToWorkDay
1554,Elizabeth Warren,"Mike Pompeo has repeatedly embraced military action over diplomatic solutions, supported interrogation techniques that amount to torture, &amp; smeared Muslim &amp; LGBTQ Americans. Tune in live as I speak about why he's unfit to serve as America’s chief diplomat:"
1555,Elizabeth Warren,"For a long time, Washington has worked for people who can write big campaign checks &amp; hire armies of lobbyists. But the Trump Admin doesn't even have the decency to be embarrassed for blatant corruption. The American people deserve better– we won't stop fighting until we get it."
1556,Elizabeth Warren,"Valeria's little sister applied for DACA, but @realdonaldtrump ended it before she could get it. A federal judge just ruled that the government must resume accepting applications like hers – but the family’s future is still uncertain. Congress needs to pass the #DreamActNow."
1557,Elizabeth Warren,This is the most corrupt administration ever.
1558,Elizabeth Warren,"Federal judges are supposed to dispense equal justice under the law. But Kyle Duncan – @realdonaldtrump’s nominee for the 5th Circuit – has spent his career working to tilt the scales of justice against women, LGBTQ Americans, people of color, &amp; others. That's why I voted no."
1559,Elizabeth Warren,"I've been fighting to pass the Firefighter Cancer Registry Act, which will allow us to better protect the firefighters who put their lives on the line for us every day. That bill just passed out of committee – making it one step closer to becoming law."
1560,Elizabeth Warren,Bob’s resilience inspires me. He’s done so much for his community – and it’s time Congress is there for him and thousands of others across the country who are touched by the opioid epidemic. We must pass legislation to invest in treatment and research before more people die.
1561,Elizabeth Warren,"Mike Pompeo’s brand of foreign policy doesn’t reflect America’s values, and won’t make us any safer. I urge my Senate colleagues to #StopPompeo and vote against his confirmation when it comes to the floor."
1562,Elizabeth Warren,"After the Boston Marathon bombing, our whole country grieved – including people of Islamic faith. But Mike Pompeo used the tragedy to scapegoat Muslim Americans. Now he wants to speak for the US while working with our Muslim allies? We need to #StopPompeo."
1563,Elizabeth Warren,"A strong State Department requires a leader who actually believes in the power of diplomacy, and the importance of protecting human rights. Mike Pompeo does not. The Senate needs to #StopPompeo."
1564,Elizabeth Warren,"This weekend, I met with members of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe to discuss the opioid crisis, which has hit Native communities particularly hard. My new bill, the #CAREact, would send $800M a year in federal funds directly to tribes to help end this"
1565,Elizabeth Warren,"The @nytimes lays out the history and scope of opioid addiction in America, lessons learned from our response to the AIDS epidemic, and possible solutions – including my bill with @RepCummings to spend $100 billion over 10 years on treatment &amp; research."
1566,Elizabeth Warren,"Last year, I got a big stack of letters from the 7th graders at Clarke Middle School. They wrote to tell me how worried they are about climate change – and why we have to fix it. This #EarthDay, I hope you’ll join me – and these kids – in the fight to protect our planet."
1567,Elizabeth Warren,The federal government needs to get out of the business of outlawing marijuana. States should make their own decisions about enforcing marijuana laws.
1568,Elizabeth Warren,"⚡️ Thirty years ago, Congress passed the Ryan White CARE Act to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This week, @RepCummings and I introduced a similar bill to fight the"
1569,Elizabeth Warren,Most of the students marching in today’s #NationalSchoolWalkout were born after the Columbine shooting. They grew up in a different world – and now they’re coming together to try and make it better. This is what democracy looks like. This is how we make change. #GunReformNow
1570,Elizabeth Warren,"For months, @SenMarkey &amp; I have fought for Puerto Rican families who evacuated to Massachusetts after Hurricane Maria. Unless @FEMA acts soon, many could wind up homeless. These are fellow US citizens – this is"
1571,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenDuckworth, I'm so glad to see the Senate take this baby step forward. I'll be the first in line to hold Maile when she makes it to the floor!"
1572,Elizabeth Warren,Enough is enough. It’s time for the Trump Administration to step up and take responsibility for the repeated blackouts in Puerto Rico that have left millions of US citizens in the dark. I'll keep fighting to get answers and help for the people of #PuertoRico.
1573,Elizabeth Warren,"I worked with @SenTedCruz to pass a bipartisan resolution designating today as Military Retiree Appreciation Day. As the sister of three vets, I know how much servicemembers contribute even after they leave the military – that deserves special recognition."
1574,Elizabeth Warren,We can’t defeat the opioid crisis with empty words and half measures. Congress acted before to stop an epidemic when it finally took action against HIV/AIDS – and Americans across the country are counting on us to do the same today. #CAREact
1575,Elizabeth Warren,"The #CAREact includes $1 billion a year for clinics and non-profits to improve addiction treatment – along with $500 million to distribute overdose reversal drugs to first responders, health departments, and the public."
1576,Elizabeth Warren,"In addition to funding for communities on the front lines of the opioid crisis, the #CAREact will provide $1.8 billion per year for biomedical research, better training for healthcare professionals, and public health surveillance, so we can better understand and treat addiction."
1577,Elizabeth Warren,"The #CAREact will provide $4 billion per year to states, territories, and tribal governments. An additional $2.7 billion per year will go directly to the counties and cities hit hardest by the epidemic."
1578,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, @RepCummings and I are introducing the #CAREact. Our bill will provide $100 billion in federal funding over the next decade so we can treat the opioid crisis the same way we tackled the HIV/AIDS epidemic – like the critical public health emergency it is."
1579,Elizabeth Warren,The Senate is on the verge of voting to make it easier for auto lenders to discriminate. Here’s why I'm voting against the GOP's latest attack on the @CFPB and fair lending laws:
1580,Elizabeth Warren,"Harry from Hull, MA tried everything to get his son out of an auto-loan scam, but no agency would help – until he contacted the @CFPB. @MickMulvaneyOMB has said we don't need a consumer protection bureau – but Harry and I disagree. American consumers need an agency on their side."
1581,Elizabeth Warren,"On #OneBostonDay, we ask the rest of the world to join our city in doing one random act of kindness – big or small. Giving back reminds us that even in the darkest moments, we can respond with compassion and kindness."
1582,Elizabeth Warren,"As we mark the fifth anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombing, I'm grateful to Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes for championing this idea and bringing it to the finish line. Their story inspires us all."
1583,Elizabeth Warren,I introduced a bipartisan bill with @SenatorCollins named after Jessica &amp; Patrick to give other survivors of terrorism with traumatic injuries access to treatment at military health care facilities. We got key provisions into the defense authorization &amp; signed into law last year.
1584,Elizabeth Warren,"Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes are a courageous young couple who both lost legs during the Boston Marathon bombing. After recovering at Walter Reed Medical, they started working to help other survivors of terrorism."
1585,Elizabeth Warren,"The Constitution gives Congress the power to authorize military action. If @realDonaldTrump wants to expand American military involvement in Syria's civil war, he must seek approval from Congress – &amp; provide a comprehensive strategy with clear goals &amp; a plan to achieve them.(2/2)"
1586,Elizabeth Warren,"Chemical attacks in Syria are horrifying, and a clear violation of international law. The world must hold Assad accountable for his violence against the Syrian people – and the US should be part of a planned, coordinated multilateral effort.(1/2)"
1587,Elizabeth Warren,"Time may be running out. Congress must immediately pass this bipartisan bill to ensure that Mueller can complete a full, independent investigation. Let’s send a loud, clear message that no one is above the law – not even the President of the United States."
1588,Elizabeth Warren,The Washington swamp just got a little dirtier. The Senate just voted to confirm former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler to be second in command at the @EPA. Now he could work to poison the agency – and the environment he's supposed to protect – for years to come.
1589,Elizabeth Warren,"On Yom Hashoah, #WeRemember the 6 million Jews who were murdered during the Holocaust. We honor their memories by continuing to stand up against hate and bigotry wherever they exist."
1590,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump has sworn up and down that he won't support bad trade deals. He pulled out of the TPP after he was elected – but now he wants back in. It’s a ridiculous reversal &amp; a slap in the face to the hard-working Americans Trump promised to fight for. TPP is a lousy deal.
1591,Elizabeth Warren,"The @CFPB was created to protect people. If @MickMulvaneyOMB wants to prevent the agency from stopping scams &amp; helping consumers, he needs to explain that to Ari, Harry, and the millions of Americans who believe the @CFPB should have their backs."
1592,Elizabeth Warren,"Harry from Hull, MA told the @CFPB about his son’s shady auto-loan. The agency looked into his complaint &amp; forced those companies to refund $6.5 million to over 50k active-duty servicemembers. Harry came to the hearing today because he wants the @CFPB to keep helping people."
1593,Elizabeth Warren,"One of those people is Ari. Before he deployed to Iraq, he bought a truck and got pushed into a subprime auto-loan scam that cost him more than 60% of his monthly paycheck. His dad Harry contacted the @CFPB on his behalf while he was deployed."
1594,Elizabeth Warren,"I just finished questioning @MickMulvaneyOMB in a Senate hearing. Before he started running the @CFPB, he tried to kill it repeatedly. If he’d gotten his wish, billions of dollars would still be sitting at the companies that cheated customers – instead of the people they cheated."
1595,Elizabeth Warren,.@MickMulvaneyOMB has been bringing up my name a lot lately when talking about the @CFPB. But what he doesn’t get is that this isn’t about me. It’s about the millions of Americans who want someone to go after the companies that cheated them.
1596,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s been four months since @MickMulvaneyOMB took over the @CFPB – and he hasn’t lifted a finger to help consumers. Today, he’s testifying before Congress, and the American people expect some answers. Watch live:"
1597,Elizabeth Warren,"The #BankLobbyistAct is dangerous enough, but now House Republicans want to load the bill up with even more favors for the financial industry. Senate supporters of the bill need to keep their word, oppose new additions, &amp; stop a bad bill from getting"
1598,Elizabeth Warren,"Women should be paid the same as men for doing the same work – period. This year, we’re marking #EqualPayDay with a court ruling that says exactly that."
1599,Elizabeth Warren,.@EPAScottPruitt is a climate denier &amp; Big Oil’s biggest fan. The only thing filthier than his stance on environmental issues is his ethics record. Pruitt never should have been put in charge of the @EPA to begin with – and he should have resigned by now.
1600,Elizabeth Warren,It’s been 5 months since @realDonaldTrump’s special commission on the opioid crisis issued its final recommendations. @PattyMurray &amp; I are asking Trump if he plans to implement any of them. Millions of Americans affected by this epidemic deserve to know.
1601,Elizabeth Warren,"Welcome to the world Maile Pearl! You are already much loved, and your mommy and many of her friends are doing their very best to make this a better world for you. We can't wait to meet you."
1602,Elizabeth Warren,"The @NRA wants you to think any attempt to protect civilians from weapons of war that can slaughter dozens in minutes is somehow unconstitutional. Most Americans know that's ridiculous. Yesterday, a federal court in Massachusetts said so when it upheld our assault weapons ban."
1603,Elizabeth Warren,".@ICEgov has changed its policy to allow increased detention of pregnant women, despite reports of mistreatment &amp; miscarriages. Pregnant women should be treated with dignity – regardless of their immigration status. This new policy seriously jeopardizes their health &amp; wellbeing."
1604,Elizabeth Warren,"Senator Daniel Akaka leaves a remarkable legacy. A veteran and the first US senator of Native Hawaiian descent, he was a passionate champion for veterans, for Native Hawaiians, for tribal self-determination, and for justice. My condolences to his family."
1605,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ll visit @BHCHP today, where I’ll talk about my plan to tackle the opioid epidemic head-on by sending significant federal funds to local communities for treatment &amp; investing in the science that will help us end this deadly crisis."
1606,Elizabeth Warren,"The State Department needs a leader who will prioritize diplomacy. The current nominee, Mike Pompeo, has defended the use of torture, tried to undermine the Iran nuclear deal, and scapegoated Muslim Americans after the Boston Marathon bombing. I won’t vote to confirm him."
1607,Elizabeth Warren,"Last year, I wrote to Ginnie Mae – a federal agency – &amp; asked it to go after mortgage lenders who exploit veterans with shady mortgage refinances. Ginnie Mae just said it will crack down on 2 of the worst offenders. This is good news for vets &amp; taxpayers."
1608,Elizabeth Warren,"Ten years after the financial crisis, banks are making record profits while wages for working families have barely ticked up. The revolving door between Wall Street &amp; Washington spins faster than ever. An important story from @WSJ that deserves to be seen."
1609,Elizabeth Warren,"I'm grateful to Ambassador Branstad, our diplomats, and the many representatives from other US government agencies who proudly represent our country in Beijing and at our consulates throughout China."
1610,Elizabeth Warren,"With Vice Premier Liu He, I had an extensive discussion about how China's trade-distorting measures end up hurting American workers. I've long been skeptical of trade policy – both at home and abroad – that caters to big corporations instead of working families."
1611,Elizabeth Warren,"In my meetings with Chinese government officials, we discussed the challenge posed by North Korea and the need for a diplomatic solution. I urged China to continue enforcing international sanctions until we see clear evidence that North Korea has changed its behavior."
1612,Elizabeth Warren,"In Beijing, I had candid discussions with Chinese officials about US-China relations, acknowledging both our shared interests and our areas of disagreement, including my concerns about China's treatment of human rights."
1613,Elizabeth Warren,"Thousands of Americans who served their communities were at risk of being denied federal student loan relief. I pushed back and helped get a new forgiveness fund that will help nurses, teachers, police officers, &amp; firefighters get the relief they’ve"
1614,Elizabeth Warren,This Black Hawk crew chief kept us safe as we flew to the DMZ. @RedSox fans have a way of finding each other – even halfway across the world. Thanks for the Sox Army patch!
1615,Elizabeth Warren,"North Korea poses a threat to South Korea, the region, and the world. I met with General Brooks, Commander of US Forces Korea, and traveled to the DMZ, where US and South Korean forces work together every day to ensure our safety."
1616,Elizabeth Warren,"My visit to South Korea came at an interesting time in the region. In Seoul, I met with Minister of Foreign Affairs Kang Kyung-wha &amp; National Security Office Director Chung Eui-yong. They are our critical allies in the preservation of peace &amp; security in the Asia Pacific region."
1617,Elizabeth Warren,.@MickMulvaneyOMB is ignoring the @CFPB’s mission and failing to comply with legal mandates – he’s doing his best to turn the CFPB into the politicized rogue agency he’s accused it of being. Republicans remain silent. I have something to say about that:
1618,Elizabeth Warren,"Defeating a public health epidemic like the opioid crisis isn't easy. It takes major resources, local control, &amp; the courage to combat stigmas. But we know what needs to be done. We've come together before to save lives – it's time for us to do so again."
1619,Elizabeth Warren,"Just like HIV/AIDS, we should ensure that every single American who needs addiction treatment and support gets it, without delay. That’s how we end the opioid crisis – not with speeches, but with treatment."
1620,Elizabeth Warren,"Our proposal isn't about public declarations and empty words. Just like HIV/AIDS, we need to provide communities that are battling the opioid epidemic every day with the funding and tools they so desperately need."
1621,Elizabeth Warren,The Ryan White CARE Act transformed how America treats HIV/AIDS. Congress must show the same political courage on opioids that our colleagues showed 30 years ago. @RepCummings and I propose a parallel approach for opioids – investing in research &amp; in treatment at the local level.
1622,Elizabeth Warren,"Thanks to the Ryan White CARE Act, over half a million people a year with HIV/AIDS receive vital services. The epidemic isn’t over – but now life-saving medications are available, new infections have plummeted, and science – rather than stigma – guides medical care."
1623,Elizabeth Warren,"In 1990, Democrats and Republicans in Congress worked together to pass the bipartisan Ryan White CARE Act – named in honor of a teen from Indiana who was diagnosed with AIDS at age 13. The law transformed our approach to treatment and provided significant new funding."
1624,Elizabeth Warren,"Three decades ago, an epidemic swept across our country, killing tens of thousands of people each year. Stigma prevented many from seeking treatment. Doctors and lawmakers alike were stumped on how to treat this rapidly evolving crisis. It wasn't opioids – it was HIV/AIDS."
1625,Elizabeth Warren,"Politicians treat the opioid crisis like it's some new, intractable problem. It's not. 30 years ago, Congress passed a law to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic – and it worked. Today, @RepCummings and I call on Congress to pass a similar law for opioids."
1626,Elizabeth Warren,Tom Hoenig – a top banking regulator &amp; political Independent – said the #BankLobbyistAct makes a serious mistake by weakening capital standards for big banks. He’s right. Inadequate capital at big banks helped create the financial crisis. We shouldn’t go down that road again.
1627,Elizabeth Warren,The census must count every person. Our Constitution demands it. Our democracy requires it. @realDonaldTrump is jeopardizing its accuracy by adding an unnecessary citizenship question. I stand with former Census directors from both parties in opposing this terrible decision.
1628,Elizabeth Warren,"I visited Hie Shrine in Tokyo, a traditional Shinto shrine, where I learned more about Japanese religious culture. And with the cherry blossoms in full bloom, the city is beautiful. I've had a wonderful time and was honored to be back in Japan for the first time in many years."
1629,Elizabeth Warren,"The men &amp; women at US Embassy Tokyo are extraordinary. Our Foreign Service Officers are the face of the US to foreign governments and people all over the world. I was glad to meet with them, and the Marine Security Guards who protect them, to thank them for their service."
1630,Elizabeth Warren,"Sullivans Elementary on Yokosuka Naval Base is the largest school in the DOD system. I met their principal, support staff, &amp; even got to stop at a classroom to giggle &amp; make funny faces. When our service members live abroad, they and their families make tremendous sacrifices."
1631,Elizabeth Warren,"I had a meaningful visit to the USS Ronald Reagan and met its crew, who proudly represent the United States in the Pacific. We had lunch in the mess and discussed how Congress can better assist our sailors and their families."
1632,Elizabeth Warren,"I've spent the last few days in Japan, meeting with Japanese government officials, and our US military and State Department officials. Our strong US-Japan alliance is critical to regional security, and our commitment to Japan's defense is ironclad."
1633,Elizabeth Warren,UPDATE: The @NLRB’s Inspector General has concluded that William Emanuel violated his ethics agreement &amp; participated in a case where he had a clear conflict of interest. Emanuel no longer has the credibility to do his job. He should resign immediately.
1634,Elizabeth Warren,Congress just made it legal to pay minor league baseball players less than minimum wage &amp; stripped away their overtime protections. This isn’t just bad policy – it’s bad baseball. Talented players shouldn’t be shut out because they can’t make a living.
1635,Elizabeth Warren,"This week, I’ll travel to Japan, South Korea, &amp; China to discuss US economic &amp; security interests in the region. If we want to succeed in Asia, America needs a foreign policy that leverages all our national power – not just our military might."
1636,Elizabeth Warren,"The only thing that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether they can handle the job. By putting gender identity first, @realDonaldTrump undermines readiness and caters to extremists who don't respect the sacrifices of our troops. Shameful."
1637,Elizabeth Warren,"Happy 8th birthday to the ACA – which forced insurers to start putting patients over profits and made a huge difference in the lives of millions of people. We've fought hard for it – and now we’re fighting for better, more affordable care for all."
1638,Elizabeth Warren,"Spending tens of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money on fancy furniture is outrageous, but the biggest scandal of Ben Carson's tenure is his refusal to enforce the laws that reduce housing discrimination and segregation in this country."
1639,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump promised to reduce US involvement in wars overseas, but his new National Security Advisor has never met a war he didn’t like. The last thing we need is someone like John Bolton who embraces military solutions first and puts us all at risk."
1640,Elizabeth Warren,Finding affordable child care today can be an impossible task. That’s why I fought tooth &amp; nail to nearly double child care funding in this year’s federal budget to $2.37B – the largest increase in the history of the program that will help tens of thousands of families.
1641,Elizabeth Warren,"The @NewYorkFed is about to choose its next president. Every past head has been white, male, &amp; cozy with big banks. How about we try someone with a new perspective and background – who’s actually willing to stand up for American families and"
1642,Elizabeth Warren,Big corporations are using the GOP tax scam to reward CEOs while laying off workers. @SenatorBaldwin has a new bill to rein in stock buybacks and give workers a stronger voice. I’m with her all the way.
1643,Elizabeth Warren,The #BankLobbyistAct is only going to get worse. House Republicans &amp; bank lobbyists want the bill to roll back more consumer protections and include more big bank giveaways. Senate supporters of this bill must not let a bad bill get even more dangerous.
1644,Elizabeth Warren,Too many Americans have to battle with their insurance companies just to see their doctor or get a prescription filled. We need a health care system that puts patients first – not insurance companies.
1645,Elizabeth Warren,"In Massachusetts, we have the highest health care coverage rate &amp; some of the lowest premiums in the country. That didn’t happen by accident: we set tough rules for insurance companies &amp; insisted they focus on families over profits. We can do the same at the federal level."
1646,Elizabeth Warren,My new bill would help stop the nasty tricks that insurance companies use to hold our health care hostage and drive up costs for families – and build on the ACA to improve the quality &amp; affordability of health insurance.
1647,Elizabeth Warren,"Today I’m introducing the Consumer Health Insurance Protection Act with @SenSanders &amp; our colleagues. We need #MedicareForAll – and until we get it, there's no reason private insurers can't provide coverage that lives up to the high standards of our public health care programs."
1648,Elizabeth Warren,"It shouldn’t require pulling teeth to get Education Secretary @BetsyDeVosED to defend non-discrimination policies. Way to persist, @RepKClark."
1649,Elizabeth Warren,"Hemos progresado un poco #6MonthsAfterMaria, pero aún tenemos un largo camino. Estaré al lado de nuestras hermanas y hermanos puertorriqueños y de las Islas Vírgenes cada paso del camino."
1650,Elizabeth Warren,"6 months ago, Hurricane Maria devastated #PuertoRico &amp; the USVI. Recovery has been too slow. I'll keep fighting for federal assistance to restore the island's electric grid, additional housing for those who lost their homes, and disaster and debt relief for PR. #6MonthsAfterMaria"
1651,Elizabeth Warren,"We’ve made some progress #6MonthsAfterMaria, but we’ve still got a long way to go. I’ll be right with our brothers and sisters from #PuertoRico and the USVI every step of the way."
1652,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m sitting down with @SenSanders, @DarrickHamilton and @MMFlint to talk about why so many hard-working Americans are struggling to get by in the richest country in the world – and what we can do about it. Tune in live. #InequalityTownHall"
1653,Elizabeth Warren,"Tonight, I’m teaming up with @SenSanders for a town hall on income inequality and poverty in America. Don’t miss it – tune in live at 7:00pm ET.https://t.co/8JduzslDl0"
1654,Elizabeth Warren,"If we want to make the promise of our legal system real, then everyone must be held equally accountable when they break our laws. We can start by bringing the white supremacists who attacked DeAndre Harris in Charlottesville to justice."
1655,Elizabeth Warren,"DeAndre Harris was severely beaten by white supremacists in Charlottesville. Were those men brought to justice? No. Instead, DeAndre was prosecuted for accidentally hitting a while supremacist with a flashlight. It's absolutely mind-boggling."
1656,Elizabeth Warren,"The words above the Supreme Court read ""Equal Justice Under Law"" – and that's supposed to be the basic promise of our legal system. But the DeAndre Harris case shows us we still have a long way to go."
1657,Elizabeth Warren,We need to hold our partners and allies accountable for using the weapons and resources we provide them. It’s time to stop giving the Saudis a blank check.
1658,Elizabeth Warren,Thousands of Yemenis have been killed as Saudi Arabia &amp; Iran carry out a proxy war. We can help end this humanitarian crisis by supporting @SenSanders &amp; @SenMikeLee's resolution to end US backing for the Saudi-led bombing campaign without congressional approval.
1659,Elizabeth Warren,"The anxiety that swept through the country in 1968 echoes the anxiety of today – especially the economic anxiety felt by millions who work harder than ever but feel opportunity slipping away. 50 years after his presidential run, we still have lots to learn from RFK."
1660,Elizabeth Warren,"Americans saving for retirement are cheated out of billions of dollars by financial advisers with conflicts of interest every year. The Trump Admin should side with working families, appeal this decision, &amp; implement the conflict-of-interest rule ASAP."
1661,Elizabeth Warren,The @USDOL's conflict-of-interest rule was designed to prevent shady financial advisers from cheating Americans out of their retirement savings. But the Trump Admin wants to weaken it – and now corporate lobbyists have found a court willing to block it.
1662,Elizabeth Warren,"When they break the law, Wall Street execs should be trading in their pinstriped suits for orange jumpsuits. After wrecking the economy in 2008, too many execs got off scot-free while millions lost their homes and savings. That’s why I introduced the Ending Too Big To Jail Act."
1663,Elizabeth Warren,"Fifty years ago today, Robert F. Kennedy launched his presidential campaign. He challenged a divided nation to face up to its failings, and challenged each and every American to do better by each other. I believe we can still live up to his legacy."
1664,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m giving @MickMulvaneyOMB one last chance to answer my questions about his actions at the @CFPB. If he won’t, he should be called immediately to testify under oath before my colleagues and me on the Senate Banking Committee."
1665,Elizabeth Warren,"Since assuming control of the @CFPB, @MickMulvaneyOMB has done favor after favor for payday lenders and the banking industry without any legal justification – and he won’t answer basic questions about his actions."
1666,Elizabeth Warren,I’ve written to @MickMulvaneyOMB 9 times in the past 3 months with 125 questions about his shady actions at the @CFPB. He has refused to answer more than 100 of them. That’s unacceptable for a public official – the American people deserve answers.
1667,Elizabeth Warren,"Today the 25th District of New York, Congress, and the American people lost a fierce fighter. Louise Slaughter was more than a trailblazer – she was a force for good. She’ll be greatly missed by so many – my heart goes out to her family and staff."
1668,Elizabeth Warren,"Dear Tim Sloan: @WellsFargo is getting sanctioned by regulators left and right. You already made 291x more than your average employee. Now you’re getting a $4.6 million raise and want praise because you’re not getting a bonus on top? You should be fired, not rewarded."
1669,Elizabeth Warren,Big banks like @WellsFargo won't clean up their act until executives start facing real consequences. I introduced the “Ending Too Big to Jail Act” to make sure executives who cheat their customers get hit with jail time – not raises.
1670,Elizabeth Warren,.@WellsFargo is about to be sanctioned for running an auto insurance scam that cost Americans millions of dollars. I don’t think that sort of corporate management merits a raise for CEO Tim Sloan.
1671,Elizabeth Warren,.@WellsFargo got a bigger handout from the GOP tax scam than any other company – and what does it do with this huge financial windfall? Turns around and hands $4.6 million to CEO Tim Sloan.
1672,Elizabeth Warren,".@WellsFargo CEO Tim Sloan enabled the bank’s massive fake accounts scam, got rich off it, and helped cover it up. He should have been fired – instead, he just got a big, fat raise."
1673,Elizabeth Warren,"When the Senate passed the #BankLobbyistAct yesterday, the banks and their lobbyists won big. Now they say this is only “a first step.” Does Congress plan to keep letting lobbyists run this place? https://t.co/qp4pFiEcCG"
1674,Elizabeth Warren,"Congress doesn’t have the courage to act on gun violence, but these young people won't stop fighting until we do. I'm with them all the way. #NationalWalkoutDay"
1675,Elizabeth Warren,An Equifax executive was just charged with insider trading – but the Senate still passed the #BankLobbyistAct to roll back oversight of huge financial institutions. Did we learn nothing from the #EquifaxBreach? We need more accountability – not
1676,Elizabeth Warren,"The American people aren’t going to stand by while big banks and giant corporations run this economy and this Congress for their own benefit. Soon – maybe not today, or next week, or even in the next election – but soon, they will demand a government that works for the people."
1677,Elizabeth Warren,I’m not giving up. We need real accountability for big banks – and the people who run them. I just introduced a new bill – the Ending Too Big to Jail Act – to help ensure bank executives are hauled out of their offices in handcuffs when they break the law.
1678,Elizabeth Warren,"Exactly ten years after the financial crisis began, the Senate has voted 67-31 to pass the #BankLobbyistAct and roll back important regulations on America’s biggest banks. We fought hard, but the big banks and their lobbyists won this round."
1679,Elizabeth Warren,Instead of working to #EndGunViolence – Republicans and Democrats came together today to deregulate the big banks and set the stage for another financial crash. Bankers are popping champagne because the #BankLobbyistAct just passed the Senate.
1680,Elizabeth Warren,"Torture doesn’t just violate our values, it jeopardizes our nat'l security and puts our military at risk. Gina Haspel’s involvement in the US’s discredited torture program makes her unfit to lead the CIA. I stand with @RandPaul, @RonWyden, &amp; other Senators against her nomination."
1681,Elizabeth Warren,I’m heading to the Senate floor one last time to try and convince the Senate to reject the #BankLobbyistAct. Watch live:
1682,Elizabeth Warren,The Senate will vote on the #BankLobbyistAct today. Tune in around 1:10pm as I urge my colleagues to stand up to big banks and vote against this legislation.
1683,Elizabeth Warren,These kids are leading the charge against gun violence – and I’m proud to be here fighting alongside them. #NationalWalkOutDay
1684,Elizabeth Warren,"Over the past six years, my friend @SenWhitehouse has delivered 199 speeches from the Senate floor calling on Congress to address climate change. Tonight, 20 Democrats are joining him for # 200. We’re proud to stand with you, Sheldon. #TimeToWakeUp"
1685,Elizabeth Warren,"Labor Secretary Alex Acosta said that “no one wants” employers to be able to steal workers’ tips, just after he proposed a rule allowing exactly that. Here's a tip @SecretaryAcosta: You should withdraw this anti-worker rule right now."
1686,Elizabeth Warren,Tune in live as I talk about a part of the #BankLobbyistAct that keeps me awake at night – the part that guts our ability to find and go after mortgage discrimination by exempting 85% of banks from reporting data about the loans they
1687,Elizabeth Warren,These aren't “community banks” – these are huge financial institutions that wrecked out economy in 2008 &amp; sucked down about $50 billion in taxpayer bailouts. The #BankLobbyistAct takes them off the watch list &amp; puts us at risk for another financial
1688,Elizabeth Warren,Zions Bancorporation got $1.4 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis. But last spring the CEO begged to be taken off the government watch list. He got his wish – the #BankLobbyistAct could apply the same rules to @ZionsBank as your local community bank.
1689,Elizabeth Warren,Comerica Incorporated controls about $72 billion in assets today &amp; has naming rights to a MLB stadium – but taxpayers spent $2.25 billion bailing it out during the 2008 financial crisis. And the #BankLobbyistAct could regulate @ComericaCares as if it were a tiny community bank.
1690,Elizabeth Warren,Huntington Bancshares Incorporated got $1.4 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis. But the #BankLobbyistAct could apply the same rules to @Huntington_Bank as your local community bank.
1691,Elizabeth Warren,"Regions Financial Corporation has about 1,500 branches and 1,900 ATMs. It also got $3.5 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 crash. If the #BankLobbyistAct passes, @askRegions could get the same level of federal oversight as a small community bank."
1692,Elizabeth Warren,"Keycorp is doing pretty well these days – it made almost $1.3 billion last year. That’s a lot of growth since the 2008 crash, when it got $2.5 billion in taxpayer bailouts. But the #BankLobbyistAct could regulate KeyCorp as if it were a small community bank."
1693,Elizabeth Warren,"Fifth Third Bancorp got $3.4 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis and has more than 1,100 branches. But if the #BankLobbyistAct passes, @fifththird could get the same amount of federal oversight as your local community bank."
1694,Elizabeth Warren,"BB&amp;T Corporation has over 2,000 branches across the country and controls $221 billion in assets. It received $3.13 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 crash. But the #BankLobbyistAct could apply the same rules to @BBT as your neighborhood community bank."
1695,Elizabeth Warren,SunTrust Bank got $4.85B in taxpayer bailouts after the financial crisis. It’s recovered pretty well. It controls $206B in assets and has a MLB stadium named after it. But the #BankLobbyistAct could regulate @Suntrust as if it were a small community bank.
1696,Elizabeth Warren,"The #BankLobbyistAct will roll back rules on 25 of America’s 40 biggest banks. Combined, they got nearly $50 billion in taxpayer bailouts after the 2008 financial crisis – and they’re back to making record profits."
1697,Elizabeth Warren,"America's biggest banks crashed the economy and took billions in taxpayer bailouts. Today, they're making record profits. But they still want more and their wish list is in the #BankLobbyistAct, which the Senate plans to pass this week. I'll fight it to the bitter end."
1698,Elizabeth Warren,".@BetsyDeVosED has bent over backwards to allow students to be cheated, taken an axe to public education, and undermined the civil rights of students across the country – and she needs to be held accountable. Track her ""progress"" on #DeVosWatch:"
1699,Elizabeth Warren,"The Secretary of Education is supposed to advocate for public education – but @BetsyDeVosED thinks public schools are a ""dead end."" She's focused on an agenda designed to weaken public schools – putting millions of students at risk."
1700,Elizabeth Warren,"It's only taken @BetsyDeVosED a year to turn back the clock on students' civil rights. She's gone after protections for victims of sexual assault, LGBTQ students, and students of color."
1701,Elizabeth Warren,"You'll be shocked to hear that @BetsyDeVosED's 1st year at @usedgov was a total failure. Instead of supporting students &amp; teachers, she's been working to make life easier for student loan companies &amp; her friends in the predatory #4profit college industry."
1702,Elizabeth Warren,".@BetsyDeVosEd should be able to answer basic questions about the public school system. A year into her term as Secretary of Education, @RepKClark and I thought it was time for a report card:"
1703,Elizabeth Warren,If you have any doubt that @BetsyDeVosED is completely unqualified to run the Department of Education – you should take a look at her recent interview with @60minutes.
1704,Elizabeth Warren,Do you think Congress should relax the rules on the big banks that got bailed out by taxpayers? The Senate votes on the #BankLobbyistAct this week and Washington is hearing loud and clear from the bank lobbyists. It's time they hear from you.
1705,Elizabeth Warren,"Yesterday I took a look at the damage caused by recent storms in Massachusetts. Over 100 homes were flooded in Quincy. It’ll take a lot of hard work to rebuild. But this is a strong, tight-knit community – and we’ll get through it together."
1706,Elizabeth Warren,"For months, I've been shouting from the rooftops about how terrible the #BankLobbyistAct is. Here's why this bill is bad for working families and the future of our financial system."
1707,Elizabeth Warren,The #BankLobbyistAct rolls back the rules on the biggest banks in the country and increases the chances of another taxpayer bailout. How can any Senator vote for that?
1708,Elizabeth Warren,Hear Mr. Estrada’s story and you’ll know why we can’t pass the #BankLobbyistAct next week. We can’t go back to a world where the banks run wild and families like the Estradas are left holding the bag.
1709,Elizabeth Warren,Today @BetsyDeVosEd told state governments they can't hold student loan companies accountable when they break state law. The Senate could stand up for students and block her move with my amendment to the #BankLobbyistAct.
1710,Elizabeth Warren,"History is repeating itself with the #BankLobbyistAct, as Republicans and Democrats prepare to vote to roll back regulations on big banks. Don't you think we should have learned our lesson by now?"
1711,Elizabeth Warren,"In the late 1990s, Senator Paul Wellstone tried to warn Congress against rolling back major federal regulations on banks. His colleagues didn't listen. They repealed Glass-Steagall and set the stage for the 2008 financial crisis."
1712,Elizabeth Warren,Watch live as I try to convince my colleagues to vote against the #BankLobbyistAct by pointing out how past bank deregulation bills have led to financial crises.
1713,Elizabeth Warren,"No one disagrees with me more vehemently about reining in Wall Street than the @WSJ Ed Board. So when THEY say the #BankLobbyistAct ""will make the financial system more vulnerable in a panic"" by gutting big bank rules, you know it's time to oppose the"
1714,Elizabeth Warren,"The people of Massachusetts didn’t send me to the Senate to fight for big banks. They sent me here to fight for them. And so long as I am privileged to hold this job, that’s exactly what I’m going to do."
1715,Elizabeth Warren,I have to call it like I see it. And the truth is the #BankLobbyistAct is a giant gift to the big banks that could put us on track for another financial crash and hurt America’s working families.
1716,Elizabeth Warren,Calling out members of my own party who are supporting the #BankLobbyistAct doesn’t make me the most popular kid on the team. But that's not why I ran for the Senate.
1717,Elizabeth Warren,2006: This CEO says it's safe to deregulate his big bank.2008: He's proven wrong when his bank gets $1.4B taxpayer bailout.2017: He's back lobbying Congress to deregulate again.This week: A bunch of Senators side with him over taxpayers by voting for the #BankLobbyistAct.
1718,Elizabeth Warren,If we're going to vote on the #BankLobbyistAct – we should vote on each of these amendments so the American people know whose side their senators are on: Working families or big banks.
1719,Elizabeth Warren,17. Amend Section 401 of the #BankLobbyistAct so it doesn't provide big banks with the giant legal loophole they need to challenge how the Fed regulates them.
1720,Elizabeth Warren,16. Amend Section 303 of the #BankLobbyistAct to keep seniors safe from financial abuse while still protecting them from bank scams.
1721,Elizabeth Warren,15. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to include consumer protections for student borrowers who take out private loans to finance their education.
1722,Elizabeth Warren,"14. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to include additional protections for student borrowers against loan servicers, lenders, and holders."
1723,Elizabeth Warren,13. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to include the Sunlight in Workplace Harassment Act – a bill I introduced to require publicly-traded companies to disclose workplace harassment &amp; discrimination settlements.
1724,Elizabeth Warren,12. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to ban the use of mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts for student loans.
1725,Elizabeth Warren,11. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to expand the CARD Act to keep students safe from predatory financial products on college campuses.
1726,Elizabeth Warren,10. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to include the bipartisan 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act that would break up the biggest banks.
1727,Elizabeth Warren,9. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to include my bill banning the use of credit reports in hiring.
1728,Elizabeth Warren,8. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to include a bill I introduced to impose automatic penalties on credit bureaus like @Equifax for data breaches.
1729,Elizabeth Warren,7. Amend Section 301 of the #BankLobbyistAct to include the FREE Act – which I introduced after the #EquifaxBreach to allow Americans to freeze their credit files without paying fees to the credit reporting agencies.
1730,Elizabeth Warren,6. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent banks that receive regulatory rollbacks from this bill from merging or acquiring another bank for 5 years. Loosening the rules on these big banks will lead to more consolidation in the banking industry unless Congress prohibits it.
1731,Elizabeth Warren,5. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent banks that receive regulatory rollbacks as a result of this bill from buying back stock for 5 years. Why would we loosen the rules on big banks just so they can shower more money on wealthy shareholders and executives?
1732,Elizabeth Warren,4. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent rolling back rules on banks that have outsourced more than 50 jobs in the last 5 years. Congress should reward keeping jobs here at home – not do favors for banks that move jobs overseas.
1733,Elizabeth Warren,3. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent rolling back rules on banks that were fined over $10 million by regulators in the last 10 years. These banks have caused enough damage already – think of the harm they could do with even fewer rules.
1734,Elizabeth Warren,2. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent rolling back rules on banks that are under Justice Department supervision after being busted for breaking the law. They broke the rules already – they shouldn't be rewarded with less oversight.
1735,Elizabeth Warren,1. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent rolling back rules on banks that received over $1 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 crisis. They already wrecked our economy once – we can't let them do it again.
1736,Elizabeth Warren,The Senate is expected to pass the #BankLobbyistAct – with Democratic support. But I'm not going down without a fight. ​I've sponsored a series of amendments to fix major flaws in the bill and add important consumer protections. Here are all 17:
1737,Elizabeth Warren,The #BankLobbyistAct is on the brink of passing the Senate. Watch live as @SenCortezMasto and I break down why this bill is a disaster for working families and could set the stage for another financial crash.
1738,Elizabeth Warren,I’m heading to the Senate floor to fight back against the #BankLobbyistAct. It’s likely to pass but I’m not going to roll over and play dead for the big banks.
1739,Elizabeth Warren,Tune in live at 4:45pm today as @SenCortezMasto and I talk about how we're fighting to protect Main Street from the #BankLobbyistAct.
1740,Elizabeth Warren,The fight over the #BankLobbyistAct isn’t over yet. I’ll do whatever I can to convince enough senators that this is a bad deal for American families. We cannot turn over the keys to our economy to the same people who crashed it ten years ago.
1741,Elizabeth Warren,Today I spoke with tribal housing authorities and advocates about passing a new Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act. Congress should pass a bill that includes all Native communities and truly addresses Indian Country's housing challenges.
1742,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m about to speak on the Senate floor about why the #BankLobbyistAct is a punch in the gut to American consumers. If it passes, it'll be harder to police banks that sell abusive mortgages and lenders who discriminate against their customers."
1743,Elizabeth Warren,Senate Republicans voted unanimously for the #BankLobbyistAct. But this bill wouldn’t be on the path to becoming law without the support of these Democrats. The Senate just voted to increase the chances your money will be used to bail out big banks again.
1744,Elizabeth Warren,Senator Elizabeth Warren answers questions about the #BankLobbyistAct
1745,Elizabeth Warren,"Instead of seeking out thank you letters from big banks and their lobbyists, we should be working on what our constituents want. That’s sure as heck not deregulating big banks with the #BankLobbyistAct."
1746,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, 13 big banks wrote a sweet thank you note to the Republicans – and Democrats – who support the #BankLobbyistAct. These banks got $30B in bailouts just a few years ago, but they are still able to get Senators of both parties to do their bidding and roll back the rules."
1747,Elizabeth Warren,"21,000 Dreamers have already lost their status. Starting today, 1,200 more will lose their work permits and be subject to deportation each day. @realDonaldTrump created this crisis - it's time for Congress to fix it and pass a #DreamActNow."
1748,Elizabeth Warren,"Erick came to the U.S. when he was 7. He now calls Chelsea, Massachusetts home. He's worried his family could be broken apart without a #DreamActNow."
1749,Elizabeth Warren,Claudia works 6 days a week as a dental assistant &amp; goes to night school to study engineering. Her Aunt Glenda has an adorable little girl she calls her “little person.” They’re afraid of going back to Guatemala — a country they barely know.​ #DreamActNow
1750,Elizabeth Warren,"Staisy came from Kenya over 20 years ago. She’s a college graduate, ABA therapist for children, and aunt to an adorable little boy. She's worried about what will happen to her family without a #DreamActNow."
1751,Elizabeth Warren,"Valeria, a die-hard Patriots fan, came from Brazil at age 7 with her mother and younger sister. Her sister applied for DACA, but @realdonaldtrump ended it before she could be approved. She's counting on a #DreamActNow to keep her family together."
1752,Elizabeth Warren,"Diana, a graduate of Harvard Divinity School, came from Mexico at age 6. She’s worked hard, played by the rules, and wants to contribute to her community. #DreamActNow"
1753,Elizabeth Warren,"Elias was brought to the United States from Venezuela when he was just 6 years old. He came to Washington to fight for a #DreamActNow on behalf of the 12,000 Dreamers in Massachusetts."
1754,Elizabeth Warren,"President​ Trump decided to end DACA effective today, placing the futures of 800,000 Dreamers in limbo. Congress urgently needs to solve this problem and pass a #DreamActNow - these kids are worth fighting for. #ProtectDreamers"
1755,Elizabeth Warren,"DACA expires tomorrow – and the future of 800,000 Dreamers is more uncertain than ever. Here are the stories of 7 Dreamers who are holding out hope that Congress will pass a #DreamActNow."
1756,Elizabeth Warren,"In her last act as Fed Chair, Janet Yellen took significant steps to hold @WellsFargo accountable for its fake accounts scam. I asked her successor, Jerome Powell, how the Fed would ensure the bank sticks to the new rules. He seems to think his staff can handle that. I disagree."
1757,Elizabeth Warren,"Are you having déjà vu yet? The #BankLobbyistAct doesn’t benefit anyone besides the big banks. It’s time for the rest of us to fight back and demand that Washington work for us, not the big bank lobbyists."
1758,Elizabeth Warren,"We’ve been down this road before. Whenever things are going ok in the financial system, the lobbyists flood the halls of Congress &amp; convince politicians to roll back the rules – because what could possibly go wrong?"
1759,Elizabeth Warren,The #BankLobbyistAct takes 25 of the 40 biggest banks in the country off the watch list for more federal oversight. It weakens consumer protections on mortgages – and makes it harder to fight racial discrimination in housing.
1760,Elizabeth Warren,"The Senate – with the support of some Democrats – is set to start debate on a bill to roll back regulations on the same big banks we bailed out a few years ago. If we lose the final vote next week, we’ll be paving the way for the next big crash."
1761,Elizabeth Warren,"The Senate should be working to #EndGunViolence. Instead, Mitch McConnell is teeing up legislation on what he thinks is a much more pressing issue: fulfilling the wish lists of big bank lobbyists."
1762,Elizabeth Warren,Betsy DeVos is the worst Secretary of Education this country has ever seen. @RepKClark and I did a full review of her first year on the job and – spoiler alert – she failed every test. #DeVosWatch
1763,Elizabeth Warren,"I have a bill with @MarkWarner that would impose massive, mandatory penalties when companies like @Equifax expose millions of Americans’ personal information. If we want to prevent another #EquifaxBreach, the Senate should pass it."
1764,Elizabeth Warren,".@Equifax can’t be trusted. Their mistakes allowed the breach to happen, their response has been a failure, and they still can’t level with the public. Enough is enough. We have to start holding the credit reporting industry accountable."
1765,Elizabeth Warren,"I spent 5 months investigating the #EquifaxBreach, and found the company failed to disclose the full extent of the hack. Today, @Equifax acknowledged that 2.4 million MORE people were affected than initially reported."
1766,Elizabeth Warren,Powerful people are actively trying to rig the system against unions and workers even more than it’s rigged now. Here’s how. #JANUSvsAFSCME
1767,Elizabeth Warren,"Congress may be at a standstill now – but Dick’s Sporting Goods’ move today shows that when people raise their voices, change can happen. We can work to #EndGunViolence by continuing to call out those who profit from the manufacturing &amp; sale of guns."
1768,Elizabeth Warren,"Every American has a right to drink clean water and breathe clean air – and that means we must do more to protect our environment now, and for future generations. Proud to be in this fight with @LCVoters."
1769,Elizabeth Warren,"I asked Admiral Mike Rogers, our top military cyber official, what Putin thinks about @realdonaldtrump’s failure to sanction Russia for interfering in our elections. His answer should concern anyone who believes the White House has a responsibility to defend our democracy."
1770,Elizabeth Warren,Big investors have made huge profits from the sale of weapons like the AR-15 rifle used at #MSD. But they’ve done next to nothing to stop gun violence. It’s time for them to look past the bottom line &amp; use their leverage for good. #EndGunViolence
1771,Elizabeth Warren,"To end sexual harassment &amp; discrimination in the workplace, we need to hold companies accountable. I introduced a bill w/@RepJackyRosen to force public companies to disclose their sexual harassment settlements. Investors – and employees – deserve to know."
1772,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, #SCOTUS heard arguments in Janus v. AFSCME. I know which side I’m on in this case – standing with teachers, nurses, firefighters, &amp; workers who want to #UnrigtheSystem &amp; join together to fight for higher wages, better benefits, &amp; retirement"
1773,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ve pressed the @NLRB for months about William Emanuel’s conflicts of interest, and the Inspector General is now investigating. Today, I asked the board to reconsider their decision, and they just said they will:"
1774,Elizabeth Warren,William Emanuel’s list of potential conflicts of interest is a mile long – and he was the key vote in a recent @NLRB decision that could allow big companies (including those represented by his former employer) to shirk their responsibilities to employees.
1775,Elizabeth Warren,"The @NLRB is supposed to protect the rights of workers to organize and fight for better wages. But the GOP has stacked its board with anti-worker, big money insiders – including William Emanuel, who used to represent big companies in cases against workers."
1776,Elizabeth Warren,"On Monday, the Supreme Court will hear Janus v. AFSCME – the latest case in a years-long assault by powerful right-wing billionaires against workers. If AFSCME loses, so will nurses, teachers, police, and firefighters all across our country. #UnrigtheSystem"
1777,Elizabeth Warren,"Last week, Congress passed my bill to help prevent scammers from taking advantage of older, lower-income vets seeking their VA benefits. It will help ensure our vets are better protected from financial fraud so they can get the care they need &amp; deserve."
1778,Elizabeth Warren,"American consumers deserve a straight answer, so today I asked @MickMulvaneyOMB again: Why are you using the @CFPB to prop up payday lenders?"
1779,Elizabeth Warren,"My motives are clear – if @MickMulvaneyOMB is interested, he can watch my speech explaining why I supported the @CFPB’s rule limiting forced arbitration. But he still hasn't explained why he’s been protecting the interests of payday lenders who financed his political campaigns."
1780,Elizabeth Warren,"I asked @MickMulvaneyOMB why he has repeatedly sided with abusive payday lenders over American families at the @CFPB. He refused to answer, and questioned my motives instead:"
1781,Elizabeth Warren,"I refuse to accept that we're a nation that breaks up families and deports hard-working young people like Erick, who was brought to the U.S. at the age of 7. I'll keep fighting for a #DreamActNow."
1782,Elizabeth Warren,This is what democracy looks like. #GunReformNow
1783,Elizabeth Warren,"I believe in markets. But markets only work if there’s a level playing field. Today, giant companies control entire industries, choking off competition &amp; forcing consumers to pay the (higher) price. We have the tools to stop it – we've got to use them."
1784,Elizabeth Warren,@WellsFargo is great at overcharging its customers for accounts and products they never asked for – but it still hasn’t figured out how to refund its victims. The CEO needs to explain why he’s making people jump through hoops just to get their money back.
1785,Elizabeth Warren,"Claudia works six days a week as a dental assistant, and at nights goes to school to study engineering. Her Aunt Glenda has an adorable little girl she calls her “little person.” Dreamers are part of America. This is their home. That’s why I’m fighting for a #DreamActNow."
1786,Elizabeth Warren,My heart goes out to everyone at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. No student should have to fear going to school. No parent should have to hear their child won’t be coming home. And tragedies like this should never happen.
1787,Elizabeth Warren,The big banks &amp; payday lenders that funded @MickMulvaneyOMB’s campaigns are doing cartwheels over @CFPB’s new strategic plan. Mulvaney wants the agency to stand up for big banks and scammers instead of holding them accountable when they cheat consumers.
1788,Elizabeth Warren,"America’s infrastructure is broken. But instead of making real investments to fix it, @realdonaldtrump wants to pass the burden on to local governments &amp; let private companies make up the difference. Americans want safer roads &amp; bridges – not higher tolls."
1789,Elizabeth Warren,Equifax must clarify its confusing and incomplete story of the #EquifaxBreach. We've got to keep the heat on @Equifax &amp; we need better laws to hold credit reporting agencies accountable:
1790,Elizabeth Warren,"My investigation revealed the depth of the breach and cover-up at @Equifax. And since I published the report, Equifax has confirmed it is even worse than they told us."
1791,Elizabeth Warren,"In October, when I asked the CEO about the precise extent of the breach, he couldn’t give me a straight answer. So for five months, I investigated it myself."
1792,Elizabeth Warren,"When hackers accessed the sensitive data of 145 million Americans, @Equifax let weeks go by before notifying the millions at risk. And that was just the beginning of the nightmare."
1793,Elizabeth Warren,Marvin Goodfriend doesn’t support government-backed mortgages – which have made home ownership possible for millions of Americans. His views range from wacky to dangerous &amp; the Senate should reject his nomination.
1794,Elizabeth Warren,Every Republican on the Banking Committee supports Marvin Goodfriend’s nomination to join the Federal Reserve. This is the guy who wants to slap a magnetic tracking strip on dollar bills and make you pay a tax if you keep cash for too long. Seriously.
1795,Elizabeth Warren,"Last year, I called out shady mortgage lenders who exploit veterans for profit, and the federal agencies in charge created a task force to address the issue. Now those lenders have been put on notice: Cut it out, or you’ll be cut off. https://t.co/DMGJWY74MN"
1796,Elizabeth Warren,"Dreamers like Staisy – a college graduate, ABA therapist for children, and aunt to an adorable little boy – should not have to live in fear of being separated from their families and friends. Time is running out for Staisy and 800k Dreamers. Congress must pass the #DreamActNow."
1797,Elizabeth Warren,"It was a challenge to find affordable child care for my own kids – it's even harder for parents today. So I fought to get more child care funding in this budget. Today, that work paid off when the Senate took a real step towards doubling child care funding for the next 2 years."
1798,Elizabeth Warren,"Watch Valeria’s story and you’ll see – Dreamers are woven into the fabric of our country. They’re students, doctors, nurses, firefighters. And they belong here. #DreamActNow"
1799,Elizabeth Warren,"The more you look at the details of the #EquifaxBreach, the worse it gets. Congress needs to pass the bill I introduced with @MarkWarner to impose tough penalties on credit bureaus like @Equifax when they compromise our data."
1800,Elizabeth Warren,"According to its own policies, @Equifax was supposed to let people know if their info was hacked. But they only notified 2.5 million. Everyone else had to go to a website that was easily spoofed and put people's data in even greater danger. #EquifaxBreach"
1801,Elizabeth Warren,"Despite its many security failures, @Equifax used a loophole to get a big contract from the IRS after the breach. It then raised its prices – cheating American taxpayers out of millions of dollars. #EquifaxBreach"
1802,Elizabeth Warren,Hackers didn’t just get a glimpse at the data of millions of Americans – they stole it from @Equifax’s system and could have access to it forever. #EquifaxBreach
1803,Elizabeth Warren,It’s clear that @MickMulvaneyOMB isn’t interested in protecting consumers from the next #EquifaxBreach – but I am. That’s why I launched an investigation into the breach 5 months ago. Here’s what I found. (The details are worse than you think.)
1804,Elizabeth Warren,"One year ago, I went to the Senate floor to oppose the nomination of Jeff Sessions to lead @TheJusticeDept. Today I'm going back to the floor to talk about his continued attacks on civil rights, immigration &amp; criminal justice reform as AG. Watch live:"
1805,Elizabeth Warren,Diana is a graduate of Harvard Divinity School and her brother is a PhD student studying pancreatic cancer. They've both worked hard and played by the rules. We cannot tear apart families like Diana’s. We need to pass a #DreamActNow.
1806,Elizabeth Warren,The @USDOL's Inspector General is now reviewing @realDonaldTrump's shady effort to reverse a rule letting tipped workers keep their earnings. Good. The least that @USDOL can do is freeze its efforts to steal workers' tips while the IG investigates what they were trying to hide.
1807,Elizabeth Warren,"We can’t rely on bought-and-paid-for @MickMulvaneyOMB to do anything about @Equifax. Congress needs to take action – like passing the bill @markwarner &amp; I introduced to ensure there are severe, automatic penalties for credit bureaus that expose your data."
1808,Elizabeth Warren,"For months, @MickMulvaneyOMB has tried to use the @CFPB to coddle the payday lenders and banks that have financed his political career."
1809,Elizabeth Warren,Another middle finger from @MickMulvaneyOMB to consumers: he’s killed the @CFPB’s probe into the #EquifaxBreach that affected more than 145 million Americans.
1810,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump has filled our top economic jobs with people obsessed with sucking up to Wall Street, &amp; today is Yellen’s last day at the Fed. Tomorrow, her replacement will face a choice: show the same kind of courage – or own the next financial crisis."
1811,Elizabeth Warren,"The massive fraud at Wells Fargo showed the whole country that we need more accountability on Wall Street. But for more than a year, we've watched as @realDonaldTrump and his government have raced to turn the big banks loose again to once again threaten our whole economy."
1812,Elizabeth Warren,Chair Yellen’s decision today to freeze the growth of Wells Fargo until it shapes up also demonstrates that we have the tools to rein in Wall Street – if our regulators have the guts to use them. This one hits them where it hurts.
1813,Elizabeth Warren,"Fines alone will never rein in fraudulent behavior at the big banks. We need tough penalties that affect the actual lives of the people who run the banks. By pushing out Board Members at Wells Fargo, Chair Yellen sent a strong message."
1814,Elizabeth Warren,"For months, I have repeatedly pressed Janet Yellen to hold Wells Fargo accountable for its fake accounts scam and push out responsible Board Members. Today she did it – in her last act as Fed Chair."
1815,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump just released his new nuclear strategy, which calls for more nuclear weapons that are easier to use. This flies in the face of decades of American leadership in building a safer world – one with fewer nuclear weapons. #NuclearPostureReview"
1816,Elizabeth Warren,This week @GOPHELP released a paper that argues for gutting accountability for shady #4profit colleges – like cheating students is no big deal. I don’t know about you – but I think that’s ridiculous. Judge for yourself:
1817,Elizabeth Warren,"The only thing shocking about the GOP's partisan memo is the contempt its release shows for the rule of law &amp; American national security. Russia is still trying to undermine our democracy – until this government starts putting this country ahead of politics, we are all at risk."
1818,Elizabeth Warren,Want to hear something outrageous? @USDOL buried a study on the Trump Admin's plan to make it harder for tipped workers to earn a living - because the data showed it would cost workers billions. The Admin must release the study &amp; end its assault on
1819,Elizabeth Warren,"America has been a global leader in science and technology for decades – but we’re slipping. To stay on the cutting edge, we have to make the right investments in basic research, STEM education, medicine, &amp; clean energy."
1820,Elizabeth Warren,"Payday lenders contributed over $60k to @MickMulvaneyOMB’s political campaigns. Now at the CFPB, Mulvaney is protecting predatory lenders instead of consumers. @RepMaxineWaters &amp; I want to know if that’s more than coincidence."
1821,Elizabeth Warren,".@RepJoeKennedy is one of the most compassionate, strongest voices fighting for an America that works for everybody. He did a great job last night – watch his Democratic response to the State of the Union:"
1822,Elizabeth Warren,My thoughts are with my Republican colleagues and all those involved in the tragic train crash in Virginia
1823,Elizabeth Warren,"Meet my guest for the #SOTU: Jean Bradley Derenoncourt. A Haitian immigrant, public servant, and proud American."
1824,Elizabeth Warren,"Honored that Jean Bradley Derenoncourt will be my #SOTU guest. He immigrated to Brockton from Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, became a citizen &amp; the first Haitian-American man elected in MA. He embodies American values of hard work, service, &amp;"
1825,Elizabeth Warren,"The GOP bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks would force women with severe health issues to stay pregnant until their lives are endangered, and force those with unviable fetuses to carry to term. This bill is dangerous and cruel – we cannot let it pass. #NoAbortionBan"
1826,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, the Senate will vote on a bill to ban all abortions after 20 weeks, with limited exceptions. Only 1% of abortions take place at 21 weeks or later – and the reasons are heartbreaking."
1827,Elizabeth Warren,We’re still defending women’s reproductive rights 45 years after #RoevWade. Why? Because politicians who’ve never been pregnant and had to make these gut-wrenching decisions want to score political points at the expense of women and their families.
1828,Elizabeth Warren,"Elias, Madelyn, &amp; Ledys came to the US as children, and built lives out of hard work and hope. But time is running out for them and 800,000 Dreamers. Congress must pass the #DreamActNow."
1829,Elizabeth Warren,"“The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference."" Today as we remember the horrors of the Holocaust and the six million Jews murdered by the Nazi regime, I think of Elie Wiesel's words. We must actively resist hate and bigotry in all its forms. #WeRemember"
1830,Elizabeth Warren,"By ending DACA, @realdonaldtrump subjected 800k Dreamers to deportation. Now he wants to hold them hostage to Steven Miller’s anti-immigrant wish list. It’s insulting. We already have a bipartisan solution to the Trump-created crisis: it’s called the Dream Act. #DreamActNow"
1831,Elizabeth Warren,The problem with NAFTA is simple: it was designed to work well for corporations instead of people. But we have a chance to rewrite the rules to benefit American workers and brings jobs back to the United States – we should take it.
1832,Elizabeth Warren,The way people pay for health care in America still puts all but the richest among us at risk. It’s time to demand a health care system that works for all of us. Tune in live as I speak at the @FamiliesUSA Health Action Conference.
1833,Elizabeth Warren,"When @realdonaldtrump ran for president he said marijuana policies should be left up to states. He should stick to his word and let states implement their own regulations – upending them only creates confusion, and puts our public health &amp; safety at risk."
1834,Elizabeth Warren,"New HHS Secretary – same story. In the ways that matter most to working families, Alex Azar is just like Tom Price. He’ll support efforts to repeal the ACA, get fewer people covered, and gut Medicaid. The American people deserve better."
1835,Elizabeth Warren,Why are Democrats helping Donald Trump and the GOP deregulate banks that got nearly $50 billion in taxpayer bailouts? #BankLobbyistsAct
1836,Elizabeth Warren,We need a Fed Chair who will stand up to Wall Street and fight for working families. We need someone who believes in tougher rules for big banks – not weaker ones. That person is not Jerome Powell.
1837,Elizabeth Warren,"Congratulations, @SenDuckworth!"
1838,Elizabeth Warren,"Puerto Rico isn't in the headlines anymore. But the need for recovery funding is no less urgent than it was four months ago. The GOP must move forward now on a bill that provides true disaster relief for PR, TX, FL, and the USVI. #PuertoRicoSeLevanta #PuertoRicoRelief"
1839,Elizabeth Warren,"Hey, Massachusetts residents – today is the last day to sign up for health care on https://t.co/OB1Z93lNs6. Don't forget to get covered!"
1840,Elizabeth Warren,"45 years after Roe v. Wade, access to safe abortion services has changed the economic futures of millions of women. #RoevWade"
1841,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s been over 100 days since protection for 800k Dreamers ended, since community health centers were funded, since hurricanes ravaged TX, FL &amp; PR. The Republicans refused to fix any of these issues– and they still haven't fixed them. We don't need new promises. We need new laws."
1842,Elizabeth Warren,"The GOP controls every branch of govt. I repeat: They control the WH &amp; Congress. They've lurched from crisis to crisis for months w/o funding disaster recovery, health centers or children's health care. All while Dreamers hang in the balance. This is no way to govern."
1843,Elizabeth Warren,"@PodSaveAmerica @SenMarkey I’ve always been on team #FightClub. I won’t vote for a CR until we get a clean Dream Act, CHIP funding and relief for Puerto Rico."
1844,Elizabeth Warren,"The Senate must act to protect our Dreamers from @realDonaldTrump's racist, anti-immigrant agenda. #DreamActNow"
1845,Elizabeth Warren,"The US should not be in the business of warrantless, dragnet surveillance of American citizens. But Section 702 of FISA allows our gov’t to do just that. I voted no on a bill to reauthorize Section 702 without important protections for Ameicans' privacy."
1846,Elizabeth Warren,The Senate should reject S. 139 and refuse to reauthorize Section 702 without real reforms to defend our right to privacy while protecting our nation.
1847,Elizabeth Warren,"The day after we honor MLK Jr., the Senate will vote on whether to reauthorize a program that would allow intelligence agencies to continue spying on Americans without meaningful oversight or critical protections for Americans’ privacy."
1848,Elizabeth Warren,"As we remember MLK Jr.’s legacy this weekend, we cannot forget that he was a victim of warrantless spying by the US government. The US has a long track record of secretly monitoring civil rights activists &amp; others who dared to stand up for their rights."
1849,Elizabeth Warren,"I was in #PuertoRico today with the MA delegation to see what can be done to help recovery efforts. It was clear that the road to recovery is long &amp; we're not moving fast enough. US citizens are suffering. We must do more to help, and we need to do it now."
1850,Elizabeth Warren,"@realDonaldTrump Eight years ago today, Joe Freddy Francois was a child in Haiti when the earthquake hit. Six years later he graduated as high school valedictorian. The character of this nation is not the character of its president. It is the character of its"
1851,Elizabeth Warren,"I could call @realDonaldTrump’s comments racist, vile and disgusting because that is what they are. But I also want to tell you about Joe Freddy Francois because immigrants from Haiti, Africa and everywhere else are an integral part of the American fabric."
1852,Elizabeth Warren,I’m fighting for Washington to work better for our veterans and all working families. Let’s pass the Protecting Veterans from Predatory Lending Act and give our vets more financial security.
1853,Elizabeth Warren,"@SenThomTillis Right now, some shady lenders can pocket huge fees by pushing veterans to refinance their VA mortgages - even when the vets end up losing money on the deal. Our bill puts a stop to that."
1854,Elizabeth Warren,I’m glad to partner with @SenThomTillis on a new bipartisan bill to crack down on lenders who are trying to exploit our veterans.
1855,Elizabeth Warren,@realDonaldTrump Responsible nations stick to their agreements – and @realDonaldTrump should stick to the #IranDeal to keep our country safe.
1856,Elizabeth Warren,"@realDonaldTrump The Iranian regime supports terror, abuses human rights, &amp; develops ballistic missiles. The worst thing we could do is make it easier for Iran to get its hands on a nuclear weapon."
1857,Elizabeth Warren,"@realDonaldTrump This week, @realdonaldtrump faces a choice: keep the #IranDeal intact, or re-impose nuclear sanctions that would violate the agreement and make it easier for Iran to get a nuclear bomb."
1858,Elizabeth Warren,"Since 2015, the #IranDeal has blocked Iran’s path to a nuclear bomb. So far, the deal is working. But @realdonaldtrump’s refusal to recertify it could change that."
1859,Elizabeth Warren,"@USChamber Here’s the basic problem in Washington. Big business lobbyists are so used to running the place that they label anyone willing to stand up to them as extreme. When Tom Donohue and the @USChamber attack me for standing up to corporate interests, I know I’m doing my job."
1860,Elizabeth Warren,Earlier today I introduced a bill to hold big companies like Equifax accountable to consumers.  Then millionaire lobbyist Tom Donohue who runs the @USChamber called me an extremist.
1861,Elizabeth Warren,"@MarkWarner @Equifax If we want @Equifax and other credit reporting agencies to act responsibly with our data, we need to hold them accountable when they screw up."
1862,Elizabeth Warren,"@MarkWarner @Equifax Had this law been in place during the Equifax breach, the company would have had to pay at least $1.5 billion in fines – half of which would have gone straight back to affected consumers. Instead, @Equifax likely made money off the hack."
1863,Elizabeth Warren,"Today @MarkWarner and I introduced a new bill that would impose massive, mandatory penalties when companies like @Equifax expose millions of Americans’ personal information."
1864,Elizabeth Warren,UPDATE: The Jobs for Heroes Act – a bipartisan effort to help veterans get jobs – got signed into law yesterday! Glad to team up with my Republican colleagues on this good idea.
1865,Elizabeth Warren,"Alex Azar wants to smile and pretend he’s different from @realDonaldTrump’s last HHS Secretary, Tom Price. But I don’t see the difference. They both want to tear down Medicaid. #SayNoToAzar"
1866,Elizabeth Warren,"@realDonaldTrump sure knows how to pick them. Tom Price, his last HHS nominee, left office in scandal. His new nominee, Alex Azar, has a resume that reads like a how-to manual for profiting off government service. #SayNoToAzar"
1867,Elizabeth Warren,States have the right to enforce their own marijuana policies – and I’m working on legislation to make sure it stays that way. Stay tuned.
1868,Elizabeth Warren,"The mayors of Massachusetts – Republicans and Democrats – are worried about @realDonaldTrump’s proposed cuts to the Community Development Block Grant. When mayors ring the alarm bell, we need to listen."
1869,Elizabeth Warren,"When corporations file for bankruptcy, they shouldn’t be able to cherry-pick courts that they think will rule in their favor. That's why @JohnCornyn and I introduced a bill to prevent big companies from manipulating the bankruptcy system."
1870,Elizabeth Warren,"@realDonaldTrump Congress should act now to pass the SECURE Act and provide qualified TPS  recipients with access to legal permanent residency. Many Salvadorans, Haitians &amp; Nicaraguans have lived, worked and paid taxes in the US  for decades. This is their home. We must #SaveTPS."
1871,Elizabeth Warren,The Trump Admin’s use of TPS to initiate wholesale deportations is fundamentally wrong. These actions do not make America stronger or safer - they weaken our economy and our communities.
1872,Elizabeth Warren,"First, the Trump Admin ended Temporary Protected Status for 2,500 Nicaraguans. Then, nearly 60,000 Haitians. Today, @realdonaldtrump crossed another item off his anti-immigrant agenda by terminating TPS for 200,000 Salvadorans."
1873,Elizabeth Warren,"Dreamers aren’t bargaining chips. They aren’t pawns in @realDonaldTrump’s game. We made a promise. We said come out of the shadows &amp; be fully woven into the fabric of America because that’s who you are. In America, we work hard &amp; dream big &amp; we must keep our promise to Dreamers."
1874,Elizabeth Warren,"Congress needs to take immediate action to protect state marijuana laws, and the patients that rely on them."
1875,Elizabeth Warren,@TheJusticeDept's reckless decision to rescind its policy allowing states to enforce their own drug policies puts our public health and safety at risk.
1876,Elizabeth Warren,States like Massachusetts have put a lot of work into implementing common sense marijuana regulations.
1877,Elizabeth Warren,Staying warm in the storm and calling into @BosPublicRadio today at noon. I’ll be talking with @jimbraude and @margeryeagan about my work standing up for working families of MA against powerful corporate interests.
1878,Elizabeth Warren,"Stay safe, Massachusetts! And follow @MassEMA and @NWSBoston for updates on #MAsnow."
1879,Elizabeth Warren,"Wishing a warm welcome to my new Senate colleagues Doug Jones and @SenTinaSmith, who were sworn in today to represent Alabama and Minnesota. Let’s get to work!"
1880,Elizabeth Warren,What does living in the shadows look like? Meet Reina and you’ll understand why we need a #DreamActNow. We can’t let @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell put this off any longer.
1881,Elizabeth Warren,"The federal deadline to sign up for health care has passed, but Massachusetts is special. We want everyone to get covered – so our deadline is January 23rd. Head to https://t.co/D6PuXPWLeg to get you and your family insured for 2018."
1882,Elizabeth Warren,I stand with the right of the Iranian people to peacefully protest. The people of Iran deserve a government that respects human rights and works to address their grievances.  #IranProtest
1883,Elizabeth Warren,"Honored to participate in the swearing-in ceremony of Framingham’s first-ever mayor, Yvonne Spicer. A gifted educator, Yvonne is now also the first African American woman popularly elected to serve as mayor of a MA city. What a wonderful way to start the new year!"
1884,Elizabeth Warren,I voted no tonight on a CR that does not include the #DreamActNow. Congress shouldn’t leave town to celebrate the holidays with our families while 800k Dreamers fear being ripped apart from their families &amp; deported to a country they barely know. We must keep our promise.
1885,Elizabeth Warren,Congress should not go home until we keep our promise to help the 800k Dreamers. Heading to the Senate floor to urge my colleagues to pass a clean #DreamActNow. Watch:
1886,Elizabeth Warren,@BetsyDeVosED After almost a year of inaction – and over 100k defrauded students waiting for answers – @BetsyDeVosED has a stingy &amp; ridiculous scheme for making many of them pay the fed govt money they don’t owe. It’s shameful.
1887,Elizabeth Warren,"When sleazy for-profit colleges break the law &amp; cheat students, the law says these defrauded students can get their entire student loan cancelled. But @BetsyDeVosED found a way to do as little as possible to help as few students as possible."
1888,Elizabeth Warren,Dreamers have been active at the Capitol this week – urging Senators to vote on a clean Dream Act before we all leave for the holidays. I’m right there with them. #DreamActNow
1889,Elizabeth Warren,"People are angry about the #GOPTaxScam – and they are right to be. I am, too."
1890,Elizabeth Warren,Starting now on @allinwithchris! #inners
1891,Elizabeth Warren,Tonight I’ll be talking to @chrislhayes about the terrible #GOPTaxScam that Republicans rammed through Congress today. Tune in! #inners
1892,Elizabeth Warren,"Sooner or later, a reckoning is coming. And I will promise you this: When it does, the politicians who lead this Congress &amp; voted for this tax heist will be held accountable for turning their backs on the American people."
1893,Elizabeth Warren,"Americans are angry. And they are right to be angry. Over &amp; over, again &amp; again, they watch this Congress ignore their problems while jumping to do more favors for billionaires, giant companies, &amp; campaign donors."
1894,Elizabeth Warren,The bill that the Republicans jammed through the Senate tonight isn’t tax reform. It’s a heist. Let's call this out for what it is: Government for sale. #GOPTaxScam
1895,Elizabeth Warren,Tonight I told the @SenateGOP who are ramming through their #GOPTaxScam: It’s a terrible day for millions of working families in this country who just want Congress to work for them.
1896,Elizabeth Warren,GOP donors are popping champagne over the #GOPTaxScam tonight. It’s shameful – and people are right to be angry. To everyone who made their voices heard: Thank you. Stay in this fight – we need you.
1897,Elizabeth Warren,The #GOPTaxScam is shameful – and it’s the result of a shameful process. Heading to the Senate floor one last time before the @SenateGOP ram through a vote on this terrible bill. Watch live NOW:
1898,Elizabeth Warren,"No, there isn’t “plenty of time” to pass the Dream Act. 30,000 Dreamers will lose their legal status each month. The Dreamers I just spoke with outside the Capitol can’t wait any longer for Congress to keep its promise. We need the #DreamActNow."
1899,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m ready to vote on a clean #DreamActNow. So are many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. A majority of Americans support this bipartisan bill. So what the heck are you waiting for, @SenateMajLdr? Let’s do this RIGHT NOW."
1900,Elizabeth Warren,@HouseGOP Big banks sucked down almost $70B in taxpayer bailouts just a few years ago – and now the @HouseGOP want to turn them loose all over again. No Democrat that claims to support working families should join the GOP in supporting this bill.
1901,Elizabeth Warren,"While the @HouseGOP are set to vote tomorrow on the #GOPTaxScam, they're also gearing up to vote on a bill that would roll back the rules on dozens of the biggest banks in the country."
1902,Elizabeth Warren,The internet doesn’t belong to big internet companies. It belongs to all of us. Read my @southcoasttoday op-ed on why people across MA &amp; around the country should fight the @FCC’s decision to kill net neutrality.
1903,Elizabeth Warren,"@DHSgov .@fema told us the death count in PR is a local matter &amp; the agency wasn't asked to help with it. A thorough review is long overdue. I hope Puerto Rico Governor @RicardoRossello requests any help from federal agencies that PR needs to determine the hurricane's full, tragic scale."
1904,Elizabeth Warren,"Two months ago, 12 senators joined me in calling on @DHSgov to provide the resources to ensure the Puerto Rico death toll is accurate, &amp; to ensure the counting methodology is sound."
1905,Elizabeth Warren,"For months, I’ve been raising concerns that the death toll in Puerto Rico due to Hurricane Maria was severely undercounted. Now, the Puerto Rican government is acknowledging this reality &amp; ordering a review of all deaths."
1906,Elizabeth Warren,Read my new @statnews op-ed on why Congress should reauthorize funding for community health centers in MA &amp; across the country right now. This should be a no-brainer.
1907,Elizabeth Warren,Our incredible community health centers in MA provide critical care at lower costs for anyone who walks through their doors. But Congress blew past the 9/30 deadline to fund community health centers. Now they’re facing impossible choices to keep the doors open.
1908,Elizabeth Warren,Read my @nytimes op-ed with @SenSanders on how this year's budget could work for working people.
1909,Elizabeth Warren,"With a government funding deadline looming, GOP leadership face a choice. Will they spend the week trying to deliver tax breaks for the rich? Or work with Dems to pass a budget that supports working people?"
1910,Elizabeth Warren,"Many moms have a child care story that sounds a lot like mine. Juggling a growing family &amp; holding a teaching job was tough as nails. Without child care, I was a goner. That’s why I’m fighting for universal child care in our end-of-year budget."
1911,Elizabeth Warren,"@AdyBarkan Republicans say they will release their final “tax bill” at 5:30pm today. Now is our last chance to stop it. I’ll be fighting this tax scam to the bitter end and need you to join me. Call, post, email and say no to the #GOPTaxScam"
1912,Elizabeth Warren,"Make no mistake: the #GOPTaxScam is not just about numbers. If Congress passes a tax bill that gives corporations massive handouts, it’ll be on the backs of people like @AdyBarkan."
1913,Elizabeth Warren,McConnell in 2010: Don’t vote on ACA until Scott Brown (R) is seated.McConnell in 2017: Don’t seat Doug Jones (D) until vote on tax bill.
1914,Elizabeth Warren,"The FCC just voted to hand control of the internet over to giant internet companies, but this isn’t over. Congress must step up to repeal this rule, restore net neutrality protections, and defend a fair and open internet."
1915,Elizabeth Warren,"Puerto Rico desperately needs help, and @Lin_Manuel explains some of the most important steps we must take. Read his column:"
1916,Elizabeth Warren,The @USTreasury's one-page “analysis” of the GOP’s multi-trillion dollar tax giveaway is a complete sham. I want answers from Secretary Mnuchin before the GOP tries to ram through their giveaway in the next few days. https://t.co/Ls9ntZfUr7
1917,Elizabeth Warren,"Tomorrow, the @FCC will vote to kill #NetNeutrality rules. We must fight to keep the Internet open and free to all."
1918,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenateGOP should follow precedent @SenateDems set after 2010 special election in MA. Delay vote on tax bill until @GDouglasJones is seated.
1919,Elizabeth Warren,"We need to fight for judges that protect the rights of all Americans, not just the wealthy &amp; the well-connected. That’s why I will be voting against these judicial nominees, &amp; I urge my colleagues to do the same."
1920,Elizabeth Warren,"This week, the GOP Senate will vote on Steven Grasz, Donny Willett, &amp; James Ho to sit on the federal courts of appeals. The records of all 3 nominees show that they will favor powerful interests over workers, women, LGBTQ individuals, people of color, &amp; religious minorities."
1921,Elizabeth Warren,"Now that there’s a GOP President who’s committed to tilting our courts further in favor of the rich &amp; the powerful, Republicans are looking to fill our courts with judges who share that commitment."
1922,Elizabeth Warren,"For years, the GOP have worked hand-in-hand with billionaire-funded right-wing groups to ensure that our courts advance the interests of the wealthy &amp; powerful over those of everybody else."
1923,Elizabeth Warren,"Are you really trying to bully, intimidate and slut-shame @SenGillibrand? Do you know who you're picking a fight with? Good luck with that, @realDonaldTrump. Nevertheless, #shepersisted."
1924,Elizabeth Warren,The American people deserve to know how this #GOPTaxScam will impact the economy and how it will affect middle-class families. @USTreasury promised an economic analysis – but this isn’t it. I look forward to the IG’s investigation providing real answers for American families.
1925,Elizabeth Warren,"To recap: After claiming repeatedly he had projections showing the #GOPTaxScam paid for itself, Mnuchin released a report showing that there were no such projections, and that even his own wildly optimistic made-up projections weren’t enough for the plan to pay for itself."
1926,Elizabeth Warren,Where does the other half of the growth come from according to @USTreasury? Partly from proposals that haven’t even been introduced in Congress and may never happen.
1927,Elizabeth Warren,But it’s worse: even Mnuchin’s made-up numbers on the corporate tax changes only get Republicans halfway to the economic growth numbers they’re claiming.
1928,Elizabeth Warren,"Mnuchin’s projection is completely out of line with other projections. It's way higher than credible estimates, and even higher than right-wing projections that ignore the effect of the national debt on growth."
1929,Elizabeth Warren,"In other words: @USTreasury’s OTP couldn’t support Mnuchin’s claims about economic growth, so he just said it again without evidence."
1930,Elizabeth Warren,"While @USTreasury’s OTP made other projections in this report, it didn’t make the key projection that growth would go up about .35% annually thanks to the corporate tax changes in the GOP tax bill."
1931,Elizabeth Warren,"A bit of important background on this claim. @USTreasury includes the Office of Tax Policy (OTP). The OTP is staffed by non-political tax experts and economists, who are responsible for projecting the economic impact of changes to the tax code."
1932,Elizabeth Warren,"But how does the report show that economic growth WILL be 2.9% instead of 2.2% thanks to the GOP tax plan? It doesn’t! Instead, @USTreasury ""expects approximately half"" of this additional growth to come from corporate tax changes."
1933,Elizabeth Warren,"@USTreasury The @USTreasury report says that IF economic growth is 2.9% instead of 2.2% over the next ten years, then the national debt will go down despite the GOP plan’s massive tax giveaway to big corporations. Oh really?"
1934,Elizabeth Warren,"In this bogus report, @USTreasury was supposed to use its economic models to project how the GOP tax plan would affect economic growth. It didn't do that. It just made up the numbers."
1935,Elizabeth Warren,"After I requested an investigation, @USTreasury finally released its ""analysis"" of the #GOPTaxScam. This one-page report is pathetic – and shows Secretary Mnuchin has no basis for claiming that the tax plan ""will pay for itself with growth."" https://t.co/3KjogQLeHE"
1936,Elizabeth Warren,Funding for kids' health insurance &amp; community health centers expired over 2 months ago. MA health advocates wrote me a letter: “Urgent action to reauthorize funding for both programs is necessary to provide certainty for both families &amp; state budgets in MA &amp; across the nation.”
1937,Elizabeth Warren,"Glad to participate in our 4th annual MA Business Matchmaker in Worcester yesterday. Small businesses are at the heart of our economy, &amp; I’m happy to work with @SBAgov to connect them with government contracting opportunities."
1938,Elizabeth Warren,Thanks to @RepLloydDoggett and @HouseDemocrats for following up on this important issue. @USTreasury should not be allowed to hide its economic analysis of the impact of the #GOPTaxScam – or hide that it never even did any analysis.
1939,Elizabeth Warren,The future of 800k Dreamers hangs in the balance. Millions of kids at risk of losing their health insurance. Pass a clean Dream Act. Reauthorize CHIP. Let’s quit kicking the can down the road. #DreamActNow
1940,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenBernieSanders &amp; I are talking about things Democrats are fighting for in this spending bill that would make a big difference to working families. Watch live now:
1941,Elizabeth Warren,The federal government will run out of money on Friday unless Congress passes a new spending bill. This isn’t just about keeping the lights on - it’s about our values.
1942,Elizabeth Warren,Watch live as I speak to @openmarkets about how competition makes our economy - and our country - stronger:
1943,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor to urge passage of the #DreamActNow. Watch live:
1944,Elizabeth Warren,"Amendment #60, which prohibits deregulation of banks that fire whistleblowers, failed, 7-16. Four Democrats voted with the Republicans against it. #BankLobbyistsAct"
1945,Elizabeth Warren,"Just offered amendment #60, which prohibits deregulation under the #BankLobbyistsAct for financial institutions that have fired or retaliated against whistleblowers."
1946,Elizabeth Warren,"Amendment #52 which stops deregulation of banks under consent decree or a deferred prosecution agreement failed, 7-16. Four Democrats voted with the Republicans against it. #BankLobbyistsAct"
1947,Elizabeth Warren,"Just offered amendment #52, which stops banks that break the law &amp; agree to a consent order or deferred prosecution agreement from getting deregulated under the #BankLobbyistsAct. Banks that break the law need more supervision, not less."
1948,Elizabeth Warren,"Amendment #49 to prohibit deregulated banks from merging with other banks for 5 years failed, 5-18. Six Democrats voted with the Republicans against it. #BankLobbyistsAct"
1949,Elizabeth Warren,"Amendment #47 to require bank execs to certify their banks aren’t breaking the law failed, 7-16. Four Democrats voted with the Republicans against it. #BankLobbyistsAct"
1950,Elizabeth Warren,"Just offered amendment #49, which prohibits any bank deregulated under the #BankLobbyistsAct from merging with another bank for 5 years. If this bill is truly about helping community banks, let’s stop big banks from gobbling up other banks."
1951,Elizabeth Warren,"Just offered amendment #47, which requires big bank execs that want to be deregulated under the #BankLobbyistsAct to sign an annual certificate that they’ve done due diligence &amp; certify that there’s no criminal conduct or civil fraud happening at their bank."
1952,Elizabeth Warren,"Amendment #44 to require public votes on million dollar settlements failed, 8-15. Four Democrats voted with the Republicans against it. #BankLobbyistsAct"
1953,Elizabeth Warren,"Amendment #57 to expand the CARD Act failed, 7-16. Four Democrats voted with the Republicans against it. #BankLobbyistsAct"
1954,Elizabeth Warren,"Sorry everyone, the @SenateBanking Committee livestream cut out. Tune in here: https://t.co/rBG3zFvmPZ #BankLobbyistsAct"
1955,Elizabeth Warren,"Just offered amendment #44, which adds the text of my bipartisan Fed Accountability Act. It requires public votes on settlements greater than $1M. #BankLobbyistsAct"
1956,Elizabeth Warren,"Just offered amendment #57, which expands the CARD Act protections for college students. Banks &amp; credit card companies would have to disclose all financial products &amp; services marketed to students on college campuses. #BankLobbyistsAct"
1957,Elizabeth Warren,"Amendment #56 to reform student loan servicing failed, 7-16. Four Democrats voted with the Republicans against it. #BankLobbyistsAct"
1958,Elizabeth Warren,"Just offered amendment #56, which reforms student loan servicing with basic consumer protections. It also gives student borrowers the right to sue the companies that administer their student loans if they break the law. #BankLobbyistsAct"
1959,Elizabeth Warren,"We’re back live in the @SenateBanking Committee, where the GOP – and some Democrats – have worked out a deal behind closed doors to deregulate big banks. I’m fighting back against the #BankLobbyistsAct. Tune in:"
1960,Elizabeth Warren,"Amendment #40 on the financial exploitation of seniors failed, 7-16. Four Democrats voted with the Republicans against it. #BankLobbyistsAct"
1961,Elizabeth Warren,"Just offered amendment #40, dealing with financial exploitation of seniors. The immunity provisions in the #BankLobbyistsAct are too broad. This helps financial firms report the exploitation of seniors without also letting banks off the hook for unrelated consumer violations."
1962,Elizabeth Warren,"Amendment #39 on the FREE Act failed, 7-16. Four Democrats voted with the Republicans against it. #BankLobbyistsAct"
1963,Elizabeth Warren,"Just called up amendment #39, which would add the FREE Act into the bill. It gives consumers more control over their own data &amp; helps people protect themselves after the Equifax breach. #BankLobbyistsAct"
1964,Elizabeth Warren,"@SenateBanking My staff will be live-tweeting the @SenateBanking #BankLobbyistsAct markup to let you know when the Senate fights for the big banks, not American consumers. Stick around."
1965,Elizabeth Warren,"In just a few minutes, the @SenateBanking Committee will be debating this terrible #BankLobbyistsAct. Watch live as I fight for a dozen amendments to put the American people first. https://t.co/rGsNoTouCS"
1966,Elizabeth Warren,That’s right: Both GOP AND Democratic Senators are trying to roll back rules for banks that took nearly $50B in taxpayer-funded bailouts. It’s insane. #BankLobbyistsAct
1967,Elizabeth Warren,We’ve already got a big problem with @realDonaldTrump trying to gut the @CFPB &amp; let the banks run loose. But now a bunch of senators – including some Dems – are trying to help out some of our country’s biggest banks by weakening financial rules.
1968,Elizabeth Warren,Tonight the @SenateGOP gave a giant tax break to the rich &amp; left everyone else holding the bag. This is about more than economics – it’s about our values. The Republicans just proved they are morally bankrupt. #GOPTaxScam
1969,Elizabeth Warren,Working families are already on the ropes – and this #GOPTaxScam is another punch in the gut. We must keep fighting back with everything we’ve got to stop them from delivering the knockout blow.
1970,Elizabeth Warren,This Congress doesn’t work for working families. It works for corporate lobbyists &amp; campaign donors in backroom deals &amp; 1:30 AM votes. This corruption is hollowing out America’s middle class &amp; tearing down our democracy.
1971,Elizabeth Warren,"The @SenateGOP just voted against protecting Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security from future cuts. Make no mistake: they’re on the chopping block next in the GOP Congress. #GOPTaxScam"
1972,Elizabeth Warren,Well there you have it: The @SenateGOP won’t even give Democrats the weekend to read all the lobbyist giveaways they’ve added in chicken scratch to the #GOPTaxScam they're jamming through tonight.
1973,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenateGOP is about to try to ram through their #GOPTaxScam bill. Tune in live.
1974,Elizabeth Warren,"No, I haven’t had time to read the 500-page #GOPTaxScam bill that we’re voting on tonight. I couldn’t read it if I tried – and I did."
1975,Elizabeth Warren,Flynn’s admission underscores the importance of the Special Prosecutor. No one is above the law – NO ONE. The American people deserve to know the truth.
1976,Elizabeth Warren,President Trump’s National Security Advisor pled guilty to a federal crime relating to his contacts with the Russian Government. This is not normal. This is not fake news. This is a serious threat to the national security of the United States.
1977,Elizabeth Warren,We can build an America where every kid has a shot at success. Where every family has some basic measure of economic security. Where every senior has enough savings to retire with dignity. That starts by defeating this #GOPTaxScam.
1978,Elizabeth Warren,I don’t think a single middle class family in this country should pay more taxes so that big corporations &amp; billionaires can pay less. Big corporations should pay MORE so that we can cut taxes on working families &amp; small businesses &amp; invest in our future. #GOPTaxScam
1979,Elizabeth Warren,The #GOPTaxScam is a smash-and-grab job. The GOP don’t even try to hide the corruption. And they don’t worry about how many middle class families are hurt in the caper.
1980,Elizabeth Warren,"This #GOPTaxScam is about paying off the rich, corporate donors that helped get the @SenateGOP elected. It’s about the way money has corrupted Washington: millions in campaign contributions for billions in tax giveaways."
1981,Elizabeth Warren,"The #GOPTaxScam isn’t about fiscal responsibility. For years, the GOP have whined about exploding debt. If this trillion-dollar #GOPTaxScam passes, the @SenateGOP will turn around next week &amp; say – sorry! There’s no money for Medicare, Medicaid, education, housing, you name it."
1982,Elizabeth Warren,The #GOPTaxScam isn’t about economic growth or jobs. Trickle down doesn’t work. But don’t take my word for it: top execs have admitted that they’ll use tax giveaways to buy back stock &amp; fund new mergers. Nothing for workers.
1983,Elizabeth Warren,The #GOPTaxScam isn’t about helping working people. It RAISES taxes for millions of middle class families. The @SenateGOP had their chance to vote to make middle class tax cuts permanent this afternoon. They voted NO.
1984,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m glad @USTreasury's IG responded quickly to my request. Either Treasury used taxpayer funds to conduct analyses it won’t release because they contradict Mnuchin’s claims that this bill grows the economy, or Mnuchin misled the public about the analysis. Either is a big problem."
1985,Elizabeth Warren,"Earlier today, I wrote to the @USTreasury Inspector General to request an investigation into Treasury’s alleged economic analysis of the GOP tax plan. https://t.co/f5loe7iDoA"
1986,Elizabeth Warren,Corporations used to pick up 25% of the cost of running the government. Now it’s 9% – and @SenateGOP wants to slash their taxes even more.
1987,Elizabeth Warren,The tax/ANWR vote is happening today. And it’s a close fight. Now is the time to let @realDonaldTrump &amp; the GOP Congress know that ANWR remains off-limits. #ProtectTheArctic
1988,Elizabeth Warren,Buried deep in the GOP tax bill – buried deep so no one would notice – is a provision to allow drilling for the first time in ANWR. It’s a shameful handout to Big Oil executives who don’t like being told an area is off-limits. #ProtectTheArctic
1989,Elizabeth Warren,The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the last untouched wildernesses in our country. It's a beautiful landscape teeming with life &amp; a national treasure that we have fought to protect for nearly 40 years. #ProtectTheArctic
1990,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenateGOP is about 24 hours away from voting on a bill that would make the middle class pay more taxes so that big corporations and millionaires can pay less. Tune is as I break it down:
1991,Elizabeth Warren,Republicans are handing corporations the tax plan of their dreams. And the rest of us will be paying for their joy ride.
1992,Elizabeth Warren,The Republican tax bill cuts taxes for corporations and raises taxes on students in debt. This is what Republican leadership looks like.
1993,Elizabeth Warren,Hear Flora’s story and you’ll understand why the @CFPB is worth fighting for.
1994,Elizabeth Warren,Trump has put a cloud of uncertainty over the @CFPB by attempting to override Dodd-Frank. Mulvaney should take no action until this dispute is decided in the courts.
1995,Elizabeth Warren,The only thing that will turn the @CFPB into a disaster is for @realDonaldTrump to ignore Dodd-Frank &amp; name an acting director determined to destroy the agency.
1996,Elizabeth Warren,"The @CFPB has returned $12 billion to working families who were cheated. That’s government that works for the people, @realDonaldTrump."
1997,Elizabeth Warren,"Less than a decade after taxpayers bailed out the big banks, the banking industry made record profits last year. That's who you're worried about, @realDonaldTrump?"
1998,Elizabeth Warren,"If @realDonaldTrump believes he is acting legally by ignoring Dodd-Frank, he should go to court &amp; seek a judgment right away to settle this @CFPB dispute."
1999,Elizabeth Warren,"By ignoring Dodd-Frank &amp; naming his own acting @CFPB Director, @realDonaldTrump is causing chaos &amp; market uncertainty. So I agree with Rich Cordray: this needs to be decided in the courts."
2000,Elizabeth Warren,"Bank lawyer Alan Kaplinsky &amp; I often disagree. But we agree that there is an ""enormous cloud of uncertainty"" over @realDonaldTrump naming Mulvaney acting @CFPB Director."
2001,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump can nominate the next @CFPB Director - but until that nominee is confirmed by the Senate, Leandra English is the Acting Director under the Dodd-Frank Act."
2002,Elizabeth Warren,"The Dodd-Frank Act is clear: if there is a @CFPB Director vacancy, the Deputy Director becomes Acting Director. @realDonaldTrump can’t override that."
2003,Elizabeth Warren,GOP claims a $1.5 trillion corporate tax cut will help working families. But who’s to say corporations won’t just run off with the money?
2004,Elizabeth Warren,"@realDonaldTrump @FCC Ending #NetNeutrality doesn’t serve the public interest or benefit American consumers – it will only benefit the handful of giant companies that will block, filter, or charge more for what we do online."
2005,Elizabeth Warren,"We don’t know who is going to have the next big idea in this country, but they’re probably going to need to get online to do it. The decision made today by @realDonaldTrump’s @FCC only tilts the playing field to favor the rich &amp; powerful who have already made it. #NetNeutrality"
2006,Elizabeth Warren,"Instead of learning from the terrible tax policy they tried in Kansas, @SenateGOP wants to replicate it nationwide."
2007,Elizabeth Warren,Mick Mulvaney thinks the @CFPB shouldn’t exist. A member of the GOP anarchy gang has no business running the agency. This is a giant middle finger to consumers.
2008,Elizabeth Warren,Tune in now!
2009,Elizabeth Warren,Tonight l’ll be talking with Rachel @Maddow about Rich Cordray &amp; the future of the @CFPB. Tune in!
2010,Elizabeth Warren,Watch live as I discuss today's breaking news that Director Rich Cordray will be stepping down as director of the @CFPB:
2011,Elizabeth Warren,The new Director of the @CFPB must be someone with a track record of protecting consumers &amp; holding financial firms responsible when they cheat people. This is no place for another Trump-appointed industry hack.
2012,Elizabeth Warren,"At the @CFPB, Rich Cordray forced the biggest financial institutions to return $12B directly to the people they cheated. He held big banks accountable. He's a dedicated public servant &amp; a tireless watchdog for US consumers – &amp; he will be missed."
2013,Elizabeth Warren,"@SenatorDurbin @BetsyDeVos And read the report @SenatorDurbin and I released this week, telling the stories of 8 students who've been cheated by shady #4profit colleges."
2014,Elizabeth Warren,Join me and @SenatorDurbin as we urge @BetsyDeVos to help students who've been defrauded by #4profit and scam colleges. #DefendStudents
2015,Elizabeth Warren,The news just broke – Senate Republicans want to rip health insurance away from 13 million Americans... through the tax bill.
2016,Elizabeth Warren,"The GOP tax plan is the same snake oil they sold in Kansas, pushed by big donors -- not working families. (They’re hoping you don’t notice.)"
2017,Elizabeth Warren,Republicans already tried slashing taxes for the rich in Kansas. It killed the state economy and working families paid the price.
2018,Elizabeth Warren,Republicans are relying on a few big lies to sell their awful tax plan. One is that slashing taxes for the rich will help working families.
2019,Elizabeth Warren,"This guy’s bank got a $1.4B bailout in 2008. Now GOP &amp; Dem Senators want to roll back rules on his bank. That’s how DC works, &amp; it stinks."
2020,Elizabeth Warren,Trump adviser and ex-banker @GaryCohn45: CEOs are “the most excited group” about GOP tax bill. Me &amp; Bernie: No kidding.
2021,Elizabeth Warren,We owe our veterans a debt we can never repay. Watch as we honored a special group of vets at the US Capitol this week. #VeteransDay
2022,Elizabeth Warren,
2023,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenFranken and I break down what CEOs will do with the tax giveaways they'll get if the GOP's corporate tax bill passes Congress.
2024,Elizabeth Warren,"Do your job, @realDonaldTrump. Your Administration must work with Puerto Rican authorities to ensure an accurate hurricane fatality count right away."
2025,Elizabeth Warren,This is important. @realDonaldTrump has cited the death count to argue his disaster response to Puerto Rico was top notch. It appears many hurricane deaths are going uncounted. Each day that passes makes it tougher to figure out the true total.
2026,Elizabeth Warren,"Last month, 12 senators joined me in calling on the Trump Administration to ensure the accuracy of the fatality count in Puerto Rico. We're still waiting."
2027,Elizabeth Warren,"Puerto Rican officials have announced a jump in deaths since Hurricane Maria, but the official hurricane death toll is still just 55."
2028,Elizabeth Warren,Read my @washingtonpost op-ed on how the GOP outsourced its economic agenda to billionaires &amp; corporate donors.
2029,Elizabeth Warren,"The GOP’s rich donors want tax giveaways, and the party is happy to oblige."
2030,Elizabeth Warren,"Thoughts &amp; prayers are not enough, GOP. We must end this violence. We must stop these tragedies. People are dying while you wait."
2031,Elizabeth Warren,How many kids must die of gun violence on playgrounds &amp; streets every day with no attention at all before we wake up to what’s happening?
2032,Elizabeth Warren,How many more people must die at churches or concerts or schools before we stop letting the @NRA control this country's gun policies?
2033,Elizabeth Warren,"I'm heartsick for the victims, families &amp; community of Sutherland Springs. But I'm more than heartsick – I'm angry."
2034,Elizabeth Warren,"The future of 700k Dreamers as American as you &amp; me hangs in the balance. Do your job, Mr. President. Stop playing politics &amp; fix this."
2035,Elizabeth Warren,"Let me be clear: If Trump doesn’t keep his word &amp; Congress doesn’t pass a clean Dream Act, I won’t vote for a spending bill without it."
2036,Elizabeth Warren,"After a meeting with the @SenateGOP, it turns out @realDonaldTrump is willing to abandon Dreamers after all."
2037,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump promised to quickly move legislation through Congress to protect Dreamers from deportation. They’re still waiting.
2038,Elizabeth Warren,The @HouseGOP tax plan isn’t about helping the middle class. It’s about shoveling favors to corporate donors.
2039,Elizabeth Warren,The GOP unveiled their tax proposal this morning. Who wins and who loses in their plan? Bernie and I will tell you.
2040,Elizabeth Warren,The Senate should reject @realDonaldTrump’s judicial nominees &amp; stop helping the rich &amp; powerful capture our courts.
2041,Elizabeth Warren,Nobody who supports 1 justice system for the rich &amp; powerful &amp; 1 for everyone else should get a lifetime appointment to the federal bench.
2042,Elizabeth Warren,"I got an update from Mayor @CarmenYulinCruz of San Juan, Puerto Rico today. She sure is a fighter."
2043,Elizabeth Warren,Read my @Politico op-ed on why Supreme Court justices must demonstrate their commitment to equal justice under law.
2044,Elizabeth Warren,"The very same day SCOTUS announced they’d hear Janus v AFSCME, Gorsuch was hobnobbing with anti-union funders at the Trump Hotel."
2045,Elizabeth Warren,Justice Gorsuch will likely be the deciding vote in a case to strip public sector unions of the resources they need to give workers a voice.
2046,Elizabeth Warren,2015: GOP Rep tries to kill the Ex-Im Bank.2017: Same guy suddenly likes the Ex-Im Bank &amp; wants to run it.You’ve got to be kidding me.
2047,Elizabeth Warren,"Keeping the victims, first responders, &amp; people of NY in our thoughts tonight. We will not let terrorism or fear divide us. #NYCStrong"
2048,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss how the GOP have helped powerful interests capture our courts. Watch:
2049,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ve seen some amazing cases of people spinning through the Washington revolving door, but Brian Montgomery for @FHAgov might take the cake."
2050,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump just doesn't get it: banning people from serving based on gender identity is shameful &amp; it makes America less safe.
2051,Elizabeth Warren,"Once again, a court has put a stop to another extreme &amp; discriminatory policy of this President."
2052,Elizabeth Warren,I'll say it again: the only thing that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether they can handle the job.
2053,Elizabeth Warren,29 days and counting.
2054,Elizabeth Warren,MA has permanent kiosks to drop off unused opioids &amp; also dropoff locations on Saturday. Find one near you:
2055,Elizabeth Warren,Saturday 10/28 is National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. Find a dropoff location to safely dispose unused drugs.
2056,Elizabeth Warren,I fought hard to pass a bipartisan bill that lets doctors &amp; patients partially fill opioid prescriptions. But you can do your part as well.
2057,Elizabeth Warren,Unused opioids often collect dust in medicine cabinets – but 70% of adults who misuse prescription opioids get them from friends/relatives.
2058,Elizabeth Warren,Millions of Americans get their wisdom teeth taken out or have minor surgery &amp; don't use all the painkillers prescribed to them.
2059,Elizabeth Warren,"@SpeakerRyan Wrong, @SpeakerRyan. No group that represents real human beings wanted to make it easier for Wall St to cheat people. Including vet groups."
2060,Elizabeth Warren,"Not once has Congress failed to authorize CHIP, which funds health care for kids. Except this year - when @SenateGOP is in control."
2061,Elizabeth Warren,It’s clear the Trump admin had 1 goal: to sabotage the ACA. @realDonaldTrump should stop the malicious attacks on US families &amp; do his job.
2062,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump's decision to cancel ACA ads was blatantly political, made with no regard for its impact on taxpayers or families."
2063,Elizabeth Warren,".@PattyMurray &amp; I called for an investigation on the ACA ads. The IG's findings, released yesterday, are disturbing."
2064,Elizabeth Warren,"Within days of taking office, @realDonaldTrump ordered @HHSGov officials to cancel ads encouraging people to sign up for ACA coverage."
2065,Elizabeth Warren,Bad news: @HouseGOP just passed the @SenateGOP budget. Who comes out ahead in this? The super-rich and big corporations.
2066,Elizabeth Warren,Over 20 military &amp; vets groups supported the @CFPB rule protecting our right to sue banks. @SenateGOP sided with the bank lobbyists instead.
2067,Elizabeth Warren,I’m cosponsoring the USA Rights Act to ensure that the gov't protects our ntl security without trampling on privacy.
2068,Elizabeth Warren,Congress must step up &amp; refuse to reauthorize Section 702's surveillance program without significant new protections for Americans’ privacy.
2069,Elizabeth Warren,The US government should not be spying on US citizens’ emails &amp; phone calls without a warrant. Period.
2070,Elizabeth Warren,Watch @VP Pence &amp; the @SenateGOP give a giant wet kiss to Wall Street late last night while they thought you weren’t looking.
2071,Elizabeth Warren,About to join @SenateDems on the floor to fight for CHIP. Children’s health doesn’t belong on the backburner. Watch:
2072,Elizabeth Warren,Tonight @VP Pence &amp; the @SenateGOP gave a giant wet kiss to Wall Street. No wonder Americans think the system is rigged against them. It is.
2073,Elizabeth Warren,I’m fighting @VP Pence &amp; the @SenateGOP's gift for the bank lobbyists until the very end. Watch live now:
2074,Elizabeth Warren,"If the @SenateGOP reverse the @CFPB’s rule tonight, they won’t be promoting a conservative agenda. They’re promoting the banks’ agenda."
2075,Elizabeth Warren,"Servicemembers, vets, seniors, and small businesses all support the @CFPB rule. Only people who don’t? Bank lobbyists. Oh, and @Equifax."
2076,Elizabeth Warren,Let’s be clear: No organization that represents actual human beings wants the @SenateGOP to reverse the @CFPB’s arbitration rule.
2077,Elizabeth Warren,"Millions of financial contracts have a clause limiting your right to go to court if you’re cheated, so the @CFPB wrote a rule to stop that."
2078,Elizabeth Warren,"We’re going to vote tonight on a @SenateGOP proposal that makes it harder to hold @WellsFargo &amp; @Equifax accountable. It's nuts, but true."
2079,Elizabeth Warren,Millions of Americans of all parties think Washington is rigged against them. Tonight’s vote is Exhibit A.
2080,Elizabeth Warren,The @SenateGOP will soon vote to take away your legal rights against big corporations. I'm fighting back. Watch now:
2081,Elizabeth Warren,Breaking: @SenateGOP to vote tomorrow to take away your legal rights against companies like @Equifax &amp; @WellsFargo. Here's what's at stake.
2082,Elizabeth Warren,Warning: calling @Equifax to freeze your credit takes forever and may not even work. We need the FREE Act so freezes are fast and free.
2083,Elizabeth Warren,"You call this A+ work, @realDonaldTrump? Give me a break. PR &amp; USVI still need much more help. NOW."
2084,Elizabeth Warren,The GOP need to stop putting children's health at risk &amp; fund CHIP.
2085,Elizabeth Warren,The latest @SenateGOP budget is garbage. We must fight back to protect the people we love and the programs we care about.
2086,Elizabeth Warren,Happy to wear purple for @GLAAD’s #SpiritDay – and to fight every day for a country where LGBTQ youth feel safe and loved.
2087,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump - do your job.
2088,Elizabeth Warren,"@BetsyDeVosED @MassAGO News flash to @BetsyDeVosED: As long as you keep ignoring the law, state AGs like @MassAGO will be there to enforce the law for students​."
2089,Elizabeth Warren,"@BetsyDeVosED @MassAGO Yesterday, 18 state AGs sued @BetsyDeVosED again for illegally suspending Obama Admin #4profit college rules."
2090,Elizabeth Warren,"@BetsyDeVosED In July, @MassAGO led 19 state AGs in suing DeVos for delaying rules to help students cheated by #4profit colleges."
2091,Elizabeth Warren,".@BetsyDeVosED has gone out of her way to give shady #4profit colleges everything on their wish list, even when it breaks the law."
2092,Elizabeth Warren,It’s long past time for @realDonaldTrump to fight for all Americans – not betray our values &amp; undermine our safety with a Muslim ban.
2093,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump just can’t take a hint. His illegal Muslim ban is now 0 for 3 vs the Constitution.
2094,Elizabeth Warren,"To the credit reporting industry, people aren’t their customers. We’re just their products. We need to reform this broken industry."
2095,Elizabeth Warren,@CFPB The last thing Congress should do is hurt people’s rights to hold big banks accountable. Read my @BostonGlobe op-ed.
2096,Elizabeth Warren,"The @CFPB's new rule stops forced arbitration clauses. Surprise, surprise: bank lobbyists hate it. They want Congress to reverse it ASAP."
2097,Elizabeth Warren,.@Equifax &amp; @WellsFargo both used forced arbitration clauses hidden in the fine print to keep millions of people from taking them to court.
2098,Elizabeth Warren,This is a disgrace. Our veterans deserve better. I’ll be demanding answers and accountability from @DeptVetAffairs.
2099,Elizabeth Warren,It’s a simple question: Do we want Iran to have a nuclear weapon or not?
2100,Elizabeth Warren,Wonder why the @GOP tax plan shovels money to billionaires while raising taxes for millions of working families?
2101,Elizabeth Warren,"If @realDonaldTrump won't reverse his birth control decision, Congress should make him. Read my @glamourmag op-ed."
2102,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump's attack on the ACA's birth control mandate not only attacked reproductive rights. It attacked women's economic freedom.
2103,Elizabeth Warren,"Responsible nations stick to their agreements. Responsible Presidents put America's safety first. If this President won't, Congress must."
2104,Elizabeth Warren,Secretary Mattis said it’s good for our national security to stay in the #Irandeal. Chairman Dunford said Iran was complying with the terms.
2105,Elizabeth Warren,"The #Irandeal is keeping Iran’s nuclear program under tough limits &amp; inspections. So far, it’s working to keep Iran away from a nuke."
2106,Elizabeth Warren,The President’s outrageous decision to decertify isolates the US from our allies &amp; increases the risk that Iran gets a nuclear bomb.
2107,Elizabeth Warren,Congress should act to stop @realDonaldTrump from following through on his threat to burn our health insurance system to the ground.
2108,Elizabeth Warren,GOP &amp; Dem governors have urged Congress to keep our promise to families &amp; hold down health insurance premiums. We should listen to them.
2109,Elizabeth Warren,"Cutting off payments that help low-income families afford health insurance is petty, cruel, &amp; just plain dumb."
2110,Elizabeth Warren,Chairman @ChuckGrassley should reject @SenateMajLdr’s dangerous proposal to end blue slips &amp; stand up for fair courts &amp; equal justice.
2111,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenateDems won’t sit silently while the rich &amp; powerful rig our courts &amp; ram through even more radical, right-wing, pro-corporate judges."
2112,Elizabeth Warren,Now @SenateMajLdr wants to end the decades-long tradition of letting senators weigh in on home-state judicial noms.
2113,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenateMajLdr McConnell &amp; the GOP used every tool to stop fair, noncontroversial Obama judicial nominees from serving on federal courts."
2114,Elizabeth Warren,Our federal govt must commit to helping the people of Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands. US citizens deserve that much from their govt.
2115,Elizabeth Warren,"Step up &amp; do your job, @realDonaldTrump. Stop lying about how well things are going in Puerto Rico. Stop trying to avoid responsibility."
2116,Elizabeth Warren,"All along, @realDonaldTrump's response in Puerto Rico has been too little, too late. But he gives himself an ""A+."" Give me a break."
2117,Elizabeth Warren,It is outrageous that @realDonaldTrump is making veiled threats to withdraw relief workers from US citizens in need. That's poor leadership.
2118,Elizabeth Warren,Puerto Rico is still facing a humanitarian crisis. @realDonaldTrump seems more worried about blaming hurricane victims than helping them.
2119,Elizabeth Warren,To all the girls out there who face challenges and barriers and people telling you no: keep fighting like a girl. #DayOfTheGirl
2120,Elizabeth Warren,I’ll keep fighting for a world where everyone feels safe to be who they are and love who they love. #NationalComingOutDay
2121,Elizabeth Warren,ALERT: Children’s Health Insurance Program is at risk. That means 9 million children could be left uninsured. @SenateGOP needs to act ASAP.
2122,Elizabeth Warren,Congress needs to step up and do its job so doctors and nurses and health centers can do theirs.
2123,Elizabeth Warren,Before millions are subjected to another data breach like @Equifax – we must do something about it. That’s why I introduced the FREE Act.
2124,Elizabeth Warren,Access to birth control is about freedom &amp; the ability to plan &amp; build a future. This attack on basic health care is wrong.
2125,Elizabeth Warren,"The year is 2017, not 1917. Millions of Americans use contraception to prevent pregnancy, avoid STIs &amp; manage health conditions."
2126,Elizabeth Warren,Evidently the GOP believe the single most important issue facing our nation is to let employers deny women access to birth control coverage.
2127,Elizabeth Warren,Enough is enough. The credit reporting industry is broken. I want consumers to have control of their own data – not companies like @Equifax.
2128,Elizabeth Warren,"It's ok, @FoxNews! We can agree that @WellsFargo CEO should be fired. This isn't about politics. It's about protecting our pocketbooks."
2129,Elizabeth Warren,Incentives for companies like @Equifax are out of whack. Consumers should control their own data. Execs should face consequences for neglect
2130,Elizabeth Warren,.@Equifax did a bad job protecting data because they had no reason to care. They’re making MORE money selling fraud protection products.
2131,Elizabeth Warren,About to question the former @Equifax CEO about his company’s inexcusable data breach &amp; response. Watch live:
2132,Elizabeth Warren,The fmr CEO of @Equifax is testifying before the @SenateBanking Committee this morning. Watch the hearing live here:
2133,Elizabeth Warren,.@WellsFargo will never change if the people responsible for the fake accounts scam are still in charge. CEO Tim Sloan needs to be fired.
2134,Elizabeth Warren,".@WellsFargo CEO Tim Sloan enabled the bank’s massive fake accounts scam, got rich off it, &amp; helped cover it up. He should be fired."
2135,Elizabeth Warren,I have more questions for @WellsFargo CEO Sloan about his plans for his lower-level employees. Watch now:
2136,Elizabeth Warren,About to question @WellsFargo CEO Sloan about his role in the massive fake accounts scandal. Watch live now:
2137,Elizabeth Warren,The new CEO of @WellsFargo is testifying before the @SenateBanking Committee. Watch the whole hearing live now:
2138,Elizabeth Warren,"The federal government cannot turn its back on our fellow US citizens who are stranded without food, water, electricity &amp; medicine."
2139,Elizabeth Warren,We are worried sick about our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. We must act NOW.
2140,Elizabeth Warren,Tragedies like Las Vegas have happened too many times. We need to have the conversation about how to stop gun violence. We need it NOW.
2141,Elizabeth Warren,"Thoughts &amp; prayers are NOT enough. Not when more moms &amp; dads will bury kids this week, &amp; more sons &amp; daughters will grow up without parents."
2142,Elizabeth Warren,I’m heartsick for people in Nevada &amp; across the country who woke up to this news &amp; are worried that their family &amp; friends are ok.
2143,Elizabeth Warren,I’m heartsick for the victims of last night’s massacre in Las Vegas &amp; their loved ones.
2144,Elizabeth Warren,"The definition of ""poor leadership"" is sitting at your golf club while millions of US citizens beg for your help, @realDonaldTrump."
2145,Elizabeth Warren,"Disaster relief workers &amp; volunteers are doing God's work right now. PR needs help, not bullying, from the @POTUS."
2146,Elizabeth Warren,"PR is in CRISIS. US citizens are dying. Millions of people need their govt's help. Stop playing politics with their lives, @realDonaldTrump."
2147,Elizabeth Warren,FEMA's Puerto Rico plans are outdated &amp; are outpaced by charities. Distribution is woefully inadequate &amp; people need basic medical care now.
2148,Elizabeth Warren,I just got off the phone with Mayor @CarmenYulinCruz. I told her to keep up her heroic work &amp; leadership on behalf of Puerto Rico.
2149,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump should use his authority to more quickly &amp; comprehensively respond to Puerto Rico &amp; the USVI. These Americans need us.
2150,Elizabeth Warren,Congress must immediately take up an appropriations bill to come to Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands’ aid.
2151,Elizabeth Warren,"Today I met with community leaders &amp; local officials in Worcester &amp; Springfield, &amp; listened to family of people struggling to survive in PR."
2152,Elizabeth Warren,"Every day, I get more &amp; more calls from people across MA who are desperately worried about the people they love in Puerto Rico."
2153,Elizabeth Warren,"With every day that passes, I’m more outraged that the federal govt isn’t doing more to help our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico &amp; the USVI."
2154,Elizabeth Warren,Puerto Rico was already suffering from an economic crisis long before it got hit by the hurricane. Now it faces another humanitarian crisis.
2155,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump should pick a new @HHSGov Sec who cares less about luxury travel &amp; ripping away health care &amp; more about families' health.
2156,Elizabeth Warren,The Janus case could tilt the playing field further in favor of corporations &amp; make it much harder for workers to stand up for themselves.
2157,Elizabeth Warren,"In deciding to take up the Janus case, the GOP-appointed SCOTUS majority is poised to deal the knock-out blow to public sector unions."
2158,Elizabeth Warren,"When the GOP stole @BarackObama's SCOTUS seat &amp; forced Gorsuch through the Senate, they knew their investment would pay off. Today it has."
2159,Elizabeth Warren,Powerful interests invested vast sums of money into confirming judges who will tilt our courts in favor of billionaires &amp; big businesses.
2160,Elizabeth Warren,#NotOnePenny in tax cuts for the wealthy &amp; giant corporations – especially not on the backs of everyone else. We'll fight this GOP tax plan.
2161,Elizabeth Warren,"And the GOP tax plan will explode the deficit, which will lead the GOP to say we need to gut Medicaid, Medicare, infrastructure &amp; education."
2162,Elizabeth Warren,The GOP plan gets rid of the state/local tax deduction for working families while repealing the estate tax for a handful of rich families.
2163,Elizabeth Warren,"While the GOP plan slashes the income tax rate for the highest earners, it increases the tax rate that applies to many working families."
2164,Elizabeth Warren,The GOP tax plan delivers massive tax cuts to millionaires &amp; giant corporations &amp; kicks working families to the curb.
2165,Elizabeth Warren,"The “new” Republican tax plan is the same warmed-over, trickle-down plan they’ve been pushing for decades."
2166,Elizabeth Warren,The people of Puerto Rico &amp; the USVI need to know their federal government hasn't forgotten them and is doing everything it can to aid them.
2167,Elizabeth Warren,Today I joined fellow Democratic senators in calling for an appropriations bill immediately to help the people of Puerto Rico &amp; the USVI.
2168,Elizabeth Warren,Millions of Americans live on Puerto Rico &amp; the USVI. They'll need huge immediate &amp; long-term aid – far more than they've received so far.
2169,Elizabeth Warren,"In the wake of powerful hurricanes, Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands face an urgent humanitarian crisis. Congress must address it NOW."
2170,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenateGOP withdrew their latest health care repeal bill because they didn’t have the votes. I have two words for you: Thank You.
2171,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump isn't following through on his promise to fix NAFTA and boost working families. It's time for Congress to take action.
2172,Elizabeth Warren,I also wrote a bill w/ @SenSherrodBrown &amp; @SenGillibrand to stop states from restricting workers' right to unionize.
2173,Elizabeth Warren,I wrote to the Admin demanding the removal of ISDS from NAFTA. We should look out for families – not corporations.
2174,Elizabeth Warren,Now @realDonaldTrump &amp; his Administration are reportedly proposing NAFTA provisions that do nothing to bring back American jobs.
2175,Elizabeth Warren,The Trump Administration has failed to get rid of ISDS - the corporate courts in NAFTA that give big businesses their own special rights.
2176,Elizabeth Warren,"Despite promising to fix NAFTA's problems, @realDonaldTrump &amp; his Admin have failed to fight for workers through the first 3 rounds."
2177,Elizabeth Warren,The fundamental problem with NAFTA is simple: the agreement doesn't work for American workers.
2178,Elizabeth Warren,The American public deserve answers about what went wrong at @Equifax and what the company plans to do going forward.
2179,Elizabeth Warren,"Former @Equifax CEO Smith, along with the new Chair &amp; interim CEO, should all testify before the Senate Banking Committee."
2180,Elizabeth Warren,It’s also not real accountability if the guy @Equifax promoted to Chair is a board member who served on the data security committee.
2181,Elizabeth Warren,It's not real accountability if the @Equifax Chairman &amp; CEO resigns without giving back a nickel in pay or publicly answering questions.
2182,Elizabeth Warren,I’ve called for @Equifax execs to be held accountable for their role in failing to stop the data breach &amp; hiding it for 40 days.
2183,Elizabeth Warren,Red alert: this vote could happen as soon as tomorrow.
2184,Elizabeth Warren,The @SenateGOP hope you won't notice when they vote to take away your legal right to take big banks to court. This is all hands on deck.
2185,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor now to tell the @SenateGOP: Stop fighting for the powerful interests &amp; do your job:
2186,Elizabeth Warren,The @SenateGOP are also on the verge of reversing a @CFPB rule that helps you hold firms like @WellsFargo &amp; @Equifax accountable in court.
2187,Elizabeth Warren,"9/30 is the deadline for funding CHIP, community health centers, Medicare programs, Medicaid payments, &amp; more. They’re waiting for a vote."
2188,Elizabeth Warren,"The @SenateGOP have tried to manufacture a health care crisis to justify repealing the ACA, but a real crisis is about to unfold."
2189,Elizabeth Warren,I’m joining the @IndivisibleTeam live now to talk about why we must #killthebill &amp; save Americans’ health care. Watch!
2190,Elizabeth Warren,A man who spent 40 yrs union busting has no business on the @NLRB. Heading to the floor to oppose William Emanuel:
2191,Elizabeth Warren,"If Congress won't stand up for workers, the very least we can do is give these workers a chance to join together &amp; stand up for themselves."
2192,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenateGOP: before you vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act next week, listen to the doctors in your state begging you not to."
2193,Elizabeth Warren,We must keep the pressure on to make sure this disaster of a bill isn’t passed next week.
2194,Elizabeth Warren,The fight to protect Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act is a fight for life and death for people who need opioid addiction treatment.
2195,Elizabeth Warren,The federal government must move quickly &amp; do whatever is needed to help Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands recover from Maria &amp; Irma.
2196,Elizabeth Warren,My thoughts are with the millions of Americans in Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands. I hope electricity and safety are restored quickly.
2197,Elizabeth Warren,"I stand with @SenFranken in saying no: We won’t let Trump &amp; the GOP bypass the process &amp; stack courts with pro-corporate, right-wing judges."
2198,Elizabeth Warren,"Even worse, Trump &amp; the GOP want Dems to blue slip (aka rubber-stamp) their pro-corporate, right-wing nominees to advance. It’s insulting."
2199,Elizabeth Warren,Trump &amp; the @SenateGOP’s latest trick: flout the precedent of consulting home-state senators on nominees to serve on courts in their states.
2200,Elizabeth Warren,But @realDonaldTrump &amp; his GOP allies are using every tool they can to tilt our courts in favor of the wealthy &amp; well-connected.
2201,Elizabeth Warren,The judges who sit on our courts should have one mission: to provide equal justice under law.
2202,Elizabeth Warren,"@Equifax @WellsFargo Corporate executives need to know they’ll be held personally accountable just like anybody else. Otherwise, the consumer scams won’t stop."
2203,Elizabeth Warren,"With the @Equifax breach, I’ll be pushing for the same type of corporate accountability that I sought in the @WellsFargo scandal."
2204,Elizabeth Warren,@WellsFargo But I'm still fighting for accountability at @WellsFargo. I'm pushing the Fed to remove all the Board Members who oversaw the scam.
2205,Elizabeth Warren,"A year ago today, I told the then-CEO of @WellsFargo he should resign after the bank's massive fake accounts scam. He did."
2206,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m doing everything I can to fight back against the Graham-Cassidy ""health care"" bill – but we need lots of people speaking up again."
2207,Elizabeth Warren,I told MGH Chelsea: The @SenateGOP Graham-Cassidy “health care” bill is just the same set of terrible policies with a fresh coat of paint.
2208,Elizabeth Warren,MGH Chelsea keeps families healthy &amp; strengthens our community. They know what repealing the ACA &amp; gutting Medicaid means to MA families.
2209,Elizabeth Warren,@Equifax The credit reporting industry is broken and has been taking advantage of consumers for years. Time to do something about it.
2210,Elizabeth Warren,The @Equifax hack is a nightmare. I introduced the FREE Act to give consumers back control of their data. Congress should pass it ASAP.
2211,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the floor to discuss the @Equifax breach. People are right to be outraged.
2212,Elizabeth Warren,RED ALERT: Trumpcare is not dead.
2213,Elizabeth Warren,@SenateGOP Tonight I’m joining @SenateDems on the floor to fight (again) to save Americans’ health care. Watch live now:
2214,Elizabeth Warren,Cassidy-Graham is just another version of the same old heartless “health care” plan the @SenateGOP have tried to jam down our throats.
2215,Elizabeth Warren,"Happy Birthday, @usairforce! Happy to celebrate last week by speaking with Senior Airman Schultz of Springfield, now deployed to SW Asia."
2216,Elizabeth Warren,"My thoughts are with the Marseille acid attack victims, reportedly BC students. My office has reached out to BC to help however we can."
2217,Elizabeth Warren,The fight to save heath care isn't over. Sound the alarm. We need you to fight today &amp; every day until this @SenateGOP bill is dead.
2218,Elizabeth Warren,"Let me repeat: The Graham-Cassidy @SenateGOP ""health care"" bill IS Trumpcare, &amp; it will rip health care away from millions of Americans."
2219,Elizabeth Warren,"Coverage ripped away from tens of millions of Americans with Graham-Cassidy – kids with disabilities, grandparents in nursing homes."
2220,Elizabeth Warren,Graham-Cassidy completely eliminates help for families to buy health insurance. Gone. Good luck on your own.
2221,Elizabeth Warren,"The @SenateGOP Graham-Cassidy ""health care"" bill cuts Medicaid funding &amp; rolls back protections for people with pre-existing conditions."
2222,Elizabeth Warren,"There's nothing new &amp; improved about the Graham-Cassidy bill – it's the same cruel @SenateGOP ""health care"" bill, but on steroids."
2223,Elizabeth Warren,The @SenateGOP have a big 9/30 deadline to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And here's the scary thing: they might have the votes to do it.
2224,Elizabeth Warren,"The Boston Harbor Dredging Project will create jobs, improve the passage of goods, &amp; improve Boston's long-term economic competitiveness."
2225,Elizabeth Warren,I was happy to join today's kickoff celebration of the Boston Harbor Dredging Project – deepening the harbor to allow bigger ships.
2226,Elizabeth Warren,The Port of Boston has been vital to our economy since the colonial era. But we need to keep investing in infrastructure for it to succeed.
2227,Elizabeth Warren,"This is good news. At least for now, @realDonaldTrump &amp; AG Sessions can’t bludgeon towns into complying with dumb &amp; dangerous ICE policies."
2228,Elizabeth Warren,.@AnthemInc's decision is great – but insurers making huge profits off taxpayers shouldn’t need to be shamed into providing coverage.
2229,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, @AnthemInc sheepishly announced that they’re partially reversing their decision to leave VA."
2230,Elizabeth Warren,"Yesterday, I called out @AnthemInc for abandoning people in states because Congress won’t help them to squeeze huge profits out of patients."
2231,Elizabeth Warren,I’m glad the Senate passed our bipartisan Jobs for Heroes Act yesterday. I hope the House will pass it soon.
2232,Elizabeth Warren,.@JohnCornyn &amp; I wrote a bipartisan bill removing obstacles that delay servicemembers' commercial drivers’ licenses.
2233,Elizabeth Warren,Veterans who have the training &amp; experience to operate trucks &amp; buses in combat zones have the skills to drive trucks on our highways.
2234,Elizabeth Warren,"@Equifax @gao @FTC @CFPB @USGAO We're fighting to hold @Equifax accountable. In the meantime, the @CFPB has a helpful guide to protect yourself:"
2235,Elizabeth Warren,"I sent letters to @Equifax, the other credit reporting agencies, regulators, &amp; @GAO to figure out how we can reform this broken industry."
2236,Elizabeth Warren,"On top of these bills, I launched an investigation into the @Equifax breach &amp; credit reporting industry in general."
2237,Elizabeth Warren,"Bad credit doesn’t make you a bad employee. Workers should compete on the merits, not on their credit scores."
2238,Elizabeth Warren,Credit reports are already riddled with errors. The @Equifax hack will make it worse. Inaccurate reports shouldn't hurt your job chances.
2239,Elizabeth Warren,I also reintroduced the Equal Employment for All Act to prevent employers from asking job applicants for their credit histories.
2240,Elizabeth Warren,The idea behind our bill is simple: @Equifax doesn't pay you when they sell your data. You shouldn't have to pay them to stop selling it.
2241,Elizabeth Warren,The FREE Act lets you freeze – and unfreeze – access to your credit file at no cost. It's like a free Do Not Call list for your credit data.
2242,Elizabeth Warren,"Companies like @Equifax make billions selling access to your data without your consent, then charge you if you want to stop them. It's nuts."
2243,Elizabeth Warren,I introduced the Freedom from Equifax Exploitation (FREE) Act with @brianschatz. Our bill gives you more control of your data.
2244,Elizabeth Warren,Lot of people are outraged about the @Equifax data breach. I am too. Here’s what I’ve been doing about it this week.
2245,Elizabeth Warren,"Today I told an @AnthemInc VP: If they want to make huge profits off taxpayers, they ought to provide decent coverage through the ACA."
2246,Elizabeth Warren,More than half of @AnthemInc's revenue comes from programs like Medicare &amp; Medicaid. But they're abandoning people in ACA exchanges.
2247,Elizabeth Warren,"Insurance giant @AnthemInc sent Congress a ransom note: bigger tax cuts, or they’d pull out of more state health care exchanges."
2248,Elizabeth Warren,"When the GOP tried to repeal the ACA, some – like @BCBSMA – fought for their customers. But not @AnthemInc."
2249,Elizabeth Warren,Undermining the INF Treaty is grossly irresponsible. Heading to the floor now to discuss my NDAA amendment. Watch:
2250,Elizabeth Warren,Today I stood with @SenSanders to support his Medicare for All bill. Health care is a basic human right &amp; we fight for basic human rights.
2251,Elizabeth Warren,@USChamber The companies paying for a @USChamber membership – they’re being taken for a ride.
2252,Elizabeth Warren,".@USChamber sucks billions of dollars from member companies – so it’ll pick a losing fight if it has to, as long as the money keeps flowing."
2253,Elizabeth Warren,"The fiduciary rule is working for consumers, start-ups and big investment companies. So why is the Chamber of Commerce trying to kill it?"
2254,Elizabeth Warren,"@RandPaul It’s long past time for Congress to do right by our troops &amp; the American people, which is why I’m supporting @RandPaul’s AUMF amendment."
2255,Elizabeth Warren,.@RandPaul is fighting for an amendment to the annual defense bill that would repeal the AUMF &amp; give Congress six months to replace it.
2256,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s been 16 yrs since Congress passed the existing AUMF after 9/11, but yr after yr, Congress refuses to re-examine this outdated policy."
2257,Elizabeth Warren,Congress owes our troops &amp; their families a full debate to authorize the use of military force before we send them into harm’s way.
2258,Elizabeth Warren,Read my @BostonGlobe op-ed on why we must give opioid addiction treatment providers the support they need.
2259,Elizabeth Warren,"I met with MA opioid addiction treatment providers who give affordable, innovative care – but they’re stretched too thin."
2260,Elizabeth Warren,"The opioid epidemic hits all of MA, so we surveyed health providers about how we can improve &amp; expand their work."
2261,Elizabeth Warren,"To everyone who wrote emails, tweeted, and showed up: Thank you! You saved health care in America. Keep it up, we need you in these fights."
2262,Elizabeth Warren,Equifax proves why we must protect your right to join class actions.
2263,Elizabeth Warren,"Keep fighting, @RepJayapal! #NeverthelessShePersisted"
2264,Elizabeth Warren,Happy to keep the Labor Day celebrations going with the Pioneer Valley CLC today!
2265,Elizabeth Warren,.@wesoldieron is an incredible organization fighting to end veteran homelessness. Very glad to visit their women's program in Leeds today.
2266,Elizabeth Warren,The @CFPB's new rule would stop companies like @Equifax from avoiding legal accountability like this -- as long as @GOP doesn't reverse it.
2267,Elizabeth Warren,That's right: @Equifax fails to protect your data and then they demand you give up legal rights if you want to limit the damage they caused.
2268,Elizabeth Warren,.@Equifax is forcing you to give up your right to join a class action against the company if you want their credit protection product.
2269,Elizabeth Warren,The @Equifax breach is Exhibit A for why we must stop @GOP from reversing the @CFPB's rule protecting your right to join class actions.
2270,Elizabeth Warren,It's also outrageous that @Equifax waited so long to disclose the breach -- needlessly leaving nearly half of America at risk for a month.
2271,Elizabeth Warren,It's outrageous that @Equifax -- a company whose one job is to collect consumer information -- failed to safeguard data for 143M Americans.
2272,Elizabeth Warren,I'm glad community bankers agree: @WellsFargo's Board should be removed. Government must hold big banks accountable.
2273,Elizabeth Warren,Debt-free college for low-income Boston U students leads to a boost in their enrollment! Way to go @BU_Tweets!
2274,Elizabeth Warren,About to speak on the Senate floor about why we must #DefendDACA and pass the Dream Act now. Watch:
2275,Elizabeth Warren,"Thank you, @MassAGO Healey, for fighting for Dreamers in MA &amp; across this country. #DefendDACA"
2276,Elizabeth Warren,The fight over @CFPB’s arbitration rule is about whose side you stand on: big Wall St banks or military families.
2277,Elizabeth Warren,"I agree, President Obama."
2278,Elizabeth Warren,"We cannot sit back while our family, friends &amp; neighbors are driven out of their homes. We must fight to protect Dreamers &amp; #DefendDACA."
2279,Elizabeth Warren,"America should keep its promises. If @realDonaldTrump doesn’t know that, then Congress must act to make DACA permanent. #DefendDACA"
2280,Elizabeth Warren,"Turning our backs on Dreamers makes us weaker, makes us less safe, &amp; betrays our values. #DefendDACA"
2281,Elizabeth Warren,Subjecting Dreamers to mass deportation is part of the bigoted policies that are a cornerstone of @realDonaldTrump’s admin. #DefendDACA
2282,Elizabeth Warren,Very proud of the @MMAAdmissions &amp; their officers for stepping up to help our friends &amp; family in the Gulf Coast.
2283,Elizabeth Warren,Read my office’s new #LaborDay report on how @realDonaldTrump has betrayed America’s working men &amp; women.
2284,Elizabeth Warren,And Trump has proposed huge cuts to @USDOL’s budget – damaging its ability to enforce labor laws &amp; protect/support workers. #LaborDay
2285,Elizabeth Warren,"Trump has delayed/weakened basic worker protections: overtime, beryllium &amp; silica exposure, mine safety, EEOC data, &amp; more. #LaborDay"
2286,Elizabeth Warren,Trump’s nominees for @USDOL &amp; @NLRB have a history of turning their backs on working people. #LaborDay
2287,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump's record is clear: over and over, he’s delivered one sucker punch after another to America's workers. #LaborDay"
2288,Elizabeth Warren,"Happy #LaborDay! Today we say loud &amp; clear: Unions built America's middle class, &amp; unions will rebuild America's middle class."
2289,Elizabeth Warren,Glad to start this #LaborDay in Worcester the 46th annual Central @MassAFLCIO Labor Day breakfast!
2290,Elizabeth Warren,"@BetsyDeVosED @usedgov Is @BetsyDeVosED trolling us with this DeVry hire? It's astounding, &amp; it’s exactly why I launched #DeVosWatch."
2291,Elizabeth Warren,@BetsyDeVosED @usedgov .@usedgov’s student aid enforcement office was literally created in response to DeVry &amp; other for-profit colleges’ fraudulent behavior.
2292,Elizabeth Warren,.@BetsyDeVosED hired a former DeVry official to be the cop in charge of policing sham colleges at @usedgov.
2293,Elizabeth Warren,Opioid treatment centers like High Point rely on Medicaid. Recent threats put their patients at risk. We need to expand – not cut – funding.
2294,Elizabeth Warren,"Last wk, I visited the High Point Treatment Center in Plymouth, a treatment facility on the front lines of the opioid epidemic. #EndOverdose"
2295,Elizabeth Warren,More than 2000 people died of opioid overdoses in Massachusetts last year. It's an epidemic – and it's heartbreaking. #EndOverdose
2296,Elizabeth Warren,To every DREAMer in this country: You are an American. This country is your home. And we’re fighting for you. #saveDACA
2297,Elizabeth Warren,Ending DACA would tear apart families &amp; rip young people away from the only country they’ve ever known. #saveDACA
2298,Elizabeth Warren,I'm proud of all the men &amp; women in uniform from Massachusetts who are helping with efforts in Houston.
2299,Elizabeth Warren,Congress also can't look the other way. We need the @WellsFargo hearing Dems called for earlier this month.
2300,Elizabeth Warren,The @federalreserve should remove every @wellsfargo Board member who served during this scandal. I don't know what they're waiting for.
2301,Elizabeth Warren,Unbelievable. @WellsFargo's massive fraud is even worse than we thought.
2302,Elizabeth Warren,"Think tanks play a critical role in shaping policy, but their credibility is jeopardized when decisions are based on funder preferences."
2303,Elizabeth Warren,This story is troubling.
2304,Elizabeth Warren,The people of the Gulf Coast desperately need our help. MA will keep doing everything we can to come to their aid.
2305,Elizabeth Warren,And I’m glad that Boston Mayor @Marty_Walsh is sending high-water rescue vehicles &amp; cots to help the people of Houston.
2306,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m also glad that two Coast Guard helicopters, a plane, &amp; crew from Cape Cod are already helping with Hurricane #Harvey rescue efforts."
2307,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m proud &amp; grateful for the FEMA volunteers based in Beverly, MA who are on their way to assist the Gulf Coast."
2308,Elizabeth Warren,"For updates, safety info &amp; ways to help Hurricane #Harvey victims, go to the @RedCross gulf coast website:"
2309,Elizabeth Warren,"When the unthinkable happens, we rely on each other for help. The victims of Hurricane #Harvey – good, hardworking people – need us now."
2310,Elizabeth Warren,"I’m heartsick for Texas. Houston is where I lived after I got married at 19, graduated from college &amp; got my 1st full-time law-teaching job."
2311,Elizabeth Warren,"Tonight's 13th town hall of year was our biggest yet: 1500 people filled Concord Carlisle HS's auditorium, cafeteria &amp; lawn. THANK YOU!"
2312,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenFranken and I need your help to stop Congress from giving away your right to hold big banks accountable. Watch:
2313,Elizabeth Warren,"Wow, 1100 people jammed Furnace Brook Middle School for our Marshfield town hall tonight! Thank you all for joining us!"
2314,Elizabeth Warren,I'm deeply grateful for the 800 people who packed our @UMassD town hall tonight &amp; made their voices heard. Thank you!
2315,Elizabeth Warren,@USRepKeating We heard from business owners &amp; community leaders about how our gov can be better partners for the South Coast (&amp; ate some terrific cheese).
2316,Elizabeth Warren,"Today I was in Fall River with @USRepKeating for a tour of Portugalia, an incredible family-owned Portuguese market."
2317,Elizabeth Warren,The President of the United States just defended neo-Nazis and blamed those who condemn their racism and hate. This is sick.
2318,Elizabeth Warren,Let me be clear: These cowardly acts of hate aren't welcome in Boston or anywhere else in this country.
2319,Elizabeth Warren,"We make judgments as humans &amp; as a country about right &amp; wrong. When there's evil, we all need to say it. Especially our President."
2320,Elizabeth Warren,How can @realDonaldTrump can show whose side he's on? He can start by publicly calling this what it is: white supremacy.
2321,Elizabeth Warren,Someone was murdered at a Neo-Nazi rally today. That happened. In America. In 2017. It's time to make clear where we stand – all of us.
2322,Elizabeth Warren,"Racism, bigotry &amp; hate are wrong - in Charlottesville &amp; anywhere else in this country. We should be a better people than that."
2323,Elizabeth Warren,This is great news for thousands of MA homeowners. @MassAGO Healey is one tough cookie!
2324,Elizabeth Warren,I'm grateful for the chance to grab dinner with MA military families in Wiesbaden. They represent our commitment to security in the region.
2325,Elizabeth Warren,We also reaffirmed the need for the US &amp; NATO to remain united in countering these asymmetric tactics from Russia.
2326,Elizabeth Warren,We reaffirmed the need to strengthen Europe's capabilities against Russia's aggressive &amp; destabilizing activities throughout Europe.
2327,Elizabeth Warren,"I spoke to a conference of senior military leaders in Germany, where I learned more about the US Army's efforts to support NATO &amp; Europe."
2328,Elizabeth Warren,"I stopped in Wiesbaden, Germany on my way back from Poland &amp; Estonia at the headquarters for US Army operations in Europe."
2329,Elizabeth Warren,I also stopped by that Soviet statue. Tiny Estonia is on the frontline of Russian aggression - but they're not moving that statue back.
2330,Elizabeth Warren,Estonia has learned a lot about orchestrated cyber-attacks. Their expertise is critical to deter &amp; defend against Russian cyber-operations.
2331,Elizabeth Warren,"In 2007, Estonia moved an old Soviet statue. For days, Estonia was subjected to a massive digital siege of its banks, media, &amp; gov websites."
2332,Elizabeth Warren,I spent time in Estonia this week meeting with top officials &amp; visiting the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence.
2333,Elizabeth Warren,"As Russia engages in aggressive, destabilizing activity in the region, it's important for allies like Poland to know the US has their backs."
2334,Elizabeth Warren,"I've also been visiting our troops in Poznan &amp; Powidz, &amp; yesterday in Powidz I got to spend time with a unit from Brockton, MA."
2335,Elizabeth Warren,"For the last few days, I've been in Poland, meeting with US &amp; Polish officials &amp; learning more about Army operations across Eastern Europe."
2336,Elizabeth Warren,"I'll miss @nikiinthehouse when she retires, &amp; MA will miss her leadership. But Niki's still got a lot of fighting left to do until then."
2337,Elizabeth Warren,Rep @nikiinthehouse is more than my colleague - she's a mentor &amp; a friend. She has shown me how tough women fight for MA families.
2338,Elizabeth Warren,We had a wonderfully thoughtful 10th town hall of the year in Revere last night with @RepKClark &amp; @joeboncore. Thanks to all who joined us!
2339,Elizabeth Warren,"After WWII, a grateful nation helped soldiers get a college education. @realDonaldTrump should sign the #ForeverGIbill to help vets again."
2340,Elizabeth Warren,And our GI Bill legislation restores benefits for veterans who were cheated by predatory for-profit Corinthian Colleges &amp; ITT Tech.
2341,Elizabeth Warren,"Our GI Bill legislation gives better Yellow Ribbon benefits for fallen servicemembers’ families, &amp; increased coverage for some reservists."
2342,Elizabeth Warren,"Our GI Bill legislation includes provisions I fought hard for to help MA vets, including expanded eligibility for Purple Heart recipients."
2343,Elizabeth Warren,I’m very glad to be an original cosponsor of a bipartisan bill to modernize &amp; expand the GI Bill. #ForeverGIbill
2344,Elizabeth Warren,Passing this bipartisan bill is good for every American who can’t afford $5000 for hearing aids. We’re going to help a lot of people.
2345,Elizabeth Warren,Huge news for millions who suffer hearing loss: Congress has passed my bill to allow certain hearing aids to be sold over the counter.
2346,Elizabeth Warren,I voted against Marvin Kaplan for the @NLRB - &amp; I reminded my colleagues why hardworking Americans need an NLRB that’s on their side.
2347,Elizabeth Warren,The Trump Admin &amp; @SenateGOP socked it to workers one more time before the summer recess: Confirming an anti-worker nominee to @NLRB.
2348,Elizabeth Warren,"Despite all the drama of the Trump Admin, there's one thing they’ve carried out with complete precision: An all-out assault on US workers."
2349,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor to oppose Marvin Kaplan - @realDonaldTrump’s anti-worker nominee to the @NLRB. Watch:
2350,Elizabeth Warren,"Rather than weakening the rules on @WellsFargo, Congress should root out all the fraud at the bank &amp; hold the right people accountable."
2351,Elizabeth Warren,"Yesterday, my @SenateBanking Democratic colleagues &amp; I asked for a hearing with the @WellsFargo CEO &amp; Board Chair. https://t.co/XVCxipz1sZ"
2352,Elizabeth Warren,"Even with @WellsFargo cheating its customers left &amp; right, the @GOP wants to roll back the rules &amp; shield big banks from accountability."
2353,Elizabeth Warren,".@WellsFargo is a mess. On top of its fake accounts, it charged almost 1M people for car insurance they didn't want."
2354,Elizabeth Warren,Congress should pass our student loan servicer bill to ensure @usedgov never heads in the wrong direction again.
2355,Elizabeth Warren,We must keep watching @usedgov to make sure its decisions are good for the millions of struggling federal student loan borrowers.
2356,Elizabeth Warren,Today @usedgov announced it will reverse its single loan servicer plan – &amp; I’m glad that they’re changing course.
2357,Elizabeth Warren,"I worked w/ @RoyBlunt, @SenatorShaheen &amp; @SenatorLankford on a bill to stop @usedgov’s terrible loan servicer plan."
2358,Elizabeth Warren,In June we sent a letter to @BetsyDeVosED with concerns that a single servicer would make an unaccountable monopoly.
2359,Elizabeth Warren,.@usedgov Sec DeVos had a plan to hand over the entire student loan portfolio to just one “Too Big to Fail” company.
2360,Elizabeth Warren,The problem with @realDonaldTrump nominee Randy Quarles? He's never stood up to the big banks in his 30-year career.
2361,Elizabeth Warren,"@realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump nominated Randy Quarles to be @federalreserve Vice Chair for Supervision, a position to regulate the big banks."
2362,Elizabeth Warren,We had a financial crisis when powerful people in government let big banks run wild. @realDonaldTrump wants to take us back down that road.
2363,Elizabeth Warren,"The nightmare is over, at least for now."
2364,Elizabeth Warren,"“Skinny repeal” is reckless, cruel &amp; immoral. If the @SenateGOP pass this bill, they'll show they just don’t care about American families."
2365,Elizabeth Warren,Only in the GOP alternative upside down reality can you hate a bill so much that you’re going to vote for it.
2366,Elizabeth Warren,"Here’s what you learn in “How to be a Senator 101”: If you support a bill, you vote yes. If you don’t, you vote no."
2367,Elizabeth Warren,"Mark my words: If the GOP can’t get a deal in committee that destroys the ACA even more, “skinny repeal” will become the law of the land."
2368,Elizabeth Warren,"If the @SenateGOP wanted a bill they could fix in committee, it could’ve been blank piece of paper. They CHOSE to intro this malicious bill."
2369,Elizabeth Warren,And here’s the worst part: The @SenateGOP knows this bill is appalling. One senator called it “a disaster.” “The dumbest thing in history.”
2370,Elizabeth Warren,CBO says this latest garbage bill will lead to 16 MILLION more uninsured.
2371,Elizabeth Warren,This @SenateGOP bill they’re voting on tonight kills a part of the ACA key to keeping insurance affordable for everyone.
2372,Elizabeth Warren,"From what I can tell, “skinny repeal” just means gutting important parts of the Affordable Care Act."
2373,Elizabeth Warren,"So here’s the deal: In the dead of night tonight, the @SenateGOP will try to pass a “skinny repeal” of health care."
2374,Elizabeth Warren,The @SenateGOP “skinny bill” is here and it’s exactly as wretched as we thought it’d be.
2375,Elizabeth Warren,"""C’mon, @SenateGOP. Pass a terrible 'skinny repeal' of health care &amp; we'll 'fix it' in committee!” ?!?"
2376,Elizabeth Warren,Health care for millions of Americans hangs in the balance and it will all unfold tonight. Here’s what’s happening:
2377,Elizabeth Warren,The American people don’t think that guaranteed health care is a joke. I look forward to the @SenateGOP learning that lesson.
2378,Elizabeth Warren,The @SenateGOP thinks guaranteed health care is all a big joke. They’re using it as a cynical ploy to play political football.
2379,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenSanders is correct: Health care is a right, not a privilege. We have a moral obligation to make sure everyone has access to it."
2380,Elizabeth Warren,"None of this needs to happen, and I hope it doesn’t."
2381,Elizabeth Warren,We won't let the @SenateGOP pass a bill that defunds Planned Parenthood and strips women's access to basic medical care. We will fight back.
2382,Elizabeth Warren,"""Skinny repeal"" should be called ""gut it and run."" Voting to destroy insurance markets and kick millions off health care remains immoral."
2383,Elizabeth Warren,"If the Senate passes ""skinny repeal"" then the @GOP will go into a back room to ""compromise"" between 15M and 23M people losing health care."
2384,Elizabeth Warren,"And ""skinny repeal"" would likely result in at least 15 MILLION people losing health insurance."
2385,Elizabeth Warren,"If the Senate passes ""skinny repeal"" – which guts the marketplace – premiums will skyrocket. Insurers will quit."
2386,Elizabeth Warren,"Senators can hide their final health care bill from the public, but they can't hide from the consequences of their votes."
2387,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenateDems will vote to protect Planned Parenthood – and we will vote down this terrible proposal.
2388,Elizabeth Warren,These next votes are on “repeal and run” of the Affordable Care Act – with a ban on Planned Parenthood funding thrown in for kicks.
2389,Elizabeth Warren,This morning @SenateDems will vote to kill @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s second attempt at ripping health care away from millions of people.
2390,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump can pretend this is a military decision, but it isn't. Banning troops on gender identity is shameful &amp; makes us less safe."
2391,Elizabeth Warren,"By attacking thousands of troops, @realDonaldTrump makes clear that he cares more about extreme ideology than military readiness."
2392,Elizabeth Warren,The only thing – only thing – that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether or not they can handle the job.
2393,Elizabeth Warren,This vote will be the first of many @SenateGOP failures. We're doing everything we can to defend the health care of millions of Americans.
2394,Elizabeth Warren,"In addition to being cruel, this first @SenateGOP proposal violates the Budget Act, so it needs 60 votes. It won't get them."
2395,Elizabeth Warren,Tonight @SenateDems will vote to kill @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s first attempt at ripping health care away from millions.
2396,Elizabeth Warren,I'll be talking with Rachel @Maddow about the @SenateGOP’s immoral health care vote soon. Tune in.
2397,Elizabeth Warren,The power to stop the Republicans’ health care bill isn’t in here. The power is with people like you.
2398,Elizabeth Warren,We're here on the Capitol steps fighting back against this immoral vote to repeal Americans' health care.
2399,Elizabeth Warren,"This is your moment in history, @SenateGOP. You can side with a political party, or the people you represent. Prove we're better than this."
2400,Elizabeth Warren,And I urge my @SenateGOP colleagues: Listen to the world’s best doctors who say repealing the ACA would be devastating for their patients.
2401,Elizabeth Warren,I urge my @SenateGOP colleagues: Listen to Jenny talk about how breast cancer &amp; autoimmune disease could bankrupt her family.
2402,Elizabeth Warren,"I urge my @SenateGOP colleagues: Listen to Chantel talk about her son Nicholas, who was born at 32 weeks &amp; needs Medicaid."
2403,Elizabeth Warren,I urge my @SenateGOP colleagues: Listen to Marika talk about her little boy who has had $4 million worth of medical care.
2404,Elizabeth Warren,"Americans have begged the @SenateGOP not to repeal their health care. Republicans, Democrats, &amp; Independents. Today, I'm begging too."
2405,Elizabeth Warren,"This is not a drill. Within the hour, @SenateGOP will vote to start the process of destroying health care – with no specific plan yet."
2406,Elizabeth Warren,".@NancyPelosi, @MaxineWaters &amp; I are speaking out against GOP efforts to roll back the arbitration rule. Watch now:"
2407,Elizabeth Warren,President @realDonaldTrump &amp; every @SenateGOP member need to read this 10-yr-old boy’s letter before they repeal his mom’s healthcare today.
2408,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the floor now to urge the @SenateGOP: listen to the American people. Don’t repeal health care. Watch:
2409,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump’s nominee for Dep Sec of the @Interior, David Bernhardt, is a corporate insider &amp; walking conflict of interest."
2410,Elizabeth Warren,Dr. Pursley says cuts to Medicaid could be the largest threat facing our children that he’s seen in his 30 years on the job:
2411,Elizabeth Warren,"We must have the @CFPB's back as Wall St's buddies in Congress try to roll back the rules. But today: we celebrate. Happy Birthday, @CFPB!"
2412,Elizabeth Warren,"The big banks have been against the @CFPB from day one, and their armies of lobbyists are doing all they can to weaken this agency."
2413,Elizabeth Warren,"For 6 years, the @CFPB has had 1 mission: to take tricks &amp; traps out of financial products like credit cards and hold cheaters accountable."
2414,Elizabeth Warren,"Today is a special day. It’s the 6th birthday of the @CFPB – or, as I like to call it, the Little Agency That Could."
2415,Elizabeth Warren,Our report shows: @realDonaldTrump’s team cares more about lining their longtime employers &amp; buddies’ pockets than helping working families.
2416,Elizabeth Warren,We released a report card tracking lobbyists &amp; insiders who have worked for @realDonaldTrump since the election. https://t.co/hklTnGGTWv
2417,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump broke his promise to “drain the swamp.” Instead of turning away lobbyists &amp; insiders, he welcomed them with open arms."
2418,Elizabeth Warren,I proudly stand with teachers to send a message to @realDonaldTrump and Education Secretary @BetsyDeVos: NO cuts to public education.
2419,Elizabeth Warren,"Just 2 weeks ago, @SenJohnMcCain &amp; I were trekking thru Pakistan &amp; Afghanistan. Trust me, John's in fighting shape &amp; we're rooting for him."
2420,Elizabeth Warren,"Our hearts are with you, @SenJohnMcCain. Stay strong &amp; keep fighting."
2421,Elizabeth Warren,It’s time for the @SenateGOP to drop this “health care” bill for good – and do it immediately.
2422,Elizabeth Warren,Data nerds at the CBO confirm that the @SenateGOP “health care” bill would knock 32 million off their insurance.
2423,Elizabeth Warren,"The @SenateGOP dug themselves into a hole, &amp; they won’t stop digging. Their ""health care"" bill has gone from bad to worse to embarrassing."
2424,Elizabeth Warren,John Bush’s disrespect for others flatly disqualifies him for the 6th Circuit. Heading to the Senate floor now:
2425,Elizabeth Warren,"Congress needs to step up &amp; pass comprehensive immigration reform. Until then, we must #defendDACA &amp; protect hard-working young immigrants."
2426,Elizabeth Warren,Extreme state AGs have threatened the Trump Admin to end #DACA. Students &amp; young workers who call the US home could be deported. #defendDACA
2427,Elizabeth Warren,"Since 2012, #DACA has protected 800k young people brought to the US as kids from mass deportation. Nearly 22k in MA alone. #defendDACA"
2428,Elizabeth Warren,I’m not at all convinced that working people can rely on William Emanuel to stand up for their rights. I opposed his confirmation to @NLRB.
2429,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump’s @NLRB pick spent decades at union-busting law firms, making it harder for workers to improve wages &amp; working conditions."
2430,Elizabeth Warren,We need to defend the ACA – but defending it isn’t enough. It’s time to make both small and big changes to improve health care in America.
2431,Elizabeth Warren,"People from MA &amp; across the country fought this cruel ""health care"" bill &amp; won. We proved: when we fight back, we can win. THANK YOU."
2432,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump intends to “let Obamacare fail” by sabotaging it from inside. We can't let down our guard now.
2433,Elizabeth Warren,I’m not doing a touchdown dance over health care today. This zombie bill has come back from the dead over &amp; over again.
2434,Elizabeth Warren,It’s abundantly clear: the @SenateGOP don’t have the votes for their tax cut bill – or the votes to repeal the ACA.
2435,Elizabeth Warren,Health care is a basic human right – and we’re still out here fighting for it. #ProtectOurCare #SaveMedicaid
2436,Elizabeth Warren,"“70% of Trump's picks for top sub-Cabinet jobs have clear corporate ties.” That’s gov that works for big corporations, not working families."
2437,Elizabeth Warren,It took 3 rooms to fit all 1300+ people who came to our town hall at Cape Cod Community College in West Barnstable today. Thank you all!
2438,Elizabeth Warren,Now House Republicans are stalling to stop this bill from becoming law. Who are they protecting: Trump or his buddies in the Kremlin?
2439,Elizabeth Warren,"If @realDonaldTrump will not stand up to Russia, the Senate will. We recently passed sanctions against Russia by a vote of 98-2."
2440,Elizabeth Warren,"President Trump asked Putin if he hacked US elections, and then asked him again ""a different way."" When Putin denied it, Trump gave up."
2441,Elizabeth Warren,Wishing my very best to @SenJohnMcCain &amp; his family. John is one of the toughest fighters I know. I'm sure he'll make a speedy recovery.
2442,Elizabeth Warren,"Holy guacamole, we had 1300 people at our Martha's Vineyard town hall this morning! This is what democracy looks like. Thank you for coming!"
2443,Elizabeth Warren,I spoke with Foxborough resident Chantel on the phone recently. She’s worried about what cuts to Medicaid would mean for her son's health.
2444,Elizabeth Warren,The Fed can remove @WellsFargo Board members for their role in the fake accounts scam. Yesterday I asked the Fed Chair: why won't you do it?
2445,Elizabeth Warren,Senator @CoryBooker &amp; I want to change our country’s approach to women in prison with the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act.
2446,Elizabeth Warren,The @SenateGOP health care bill released today is the worst one yet:
2447,Elizabeth Warren,I'm reading the latest way that Senate Republicans plan to rip health care away from millions of people. I'll share my thoughts soon.
2448,Elizabeth Warren,Thanks @studentvets! Glad to help our vets with student loans get the benefits they deserve. @PattyMurray &amp; I have been at this for a year.
2449,Elizabeth Warren,We need a free &amp; open internet – not one that tilts the playing field for the rich &amp; powerful who already made it. We need #netneutrality
2450,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump’s @FCC wants to end #netneutrality so a handful of big companies can block, filter or charge more for what we do online."
2451,Elizabeth Warren,"We don’t know who is going to have the next big idea in this country, but they’re probably going to need to get online to do it."
2452,Elizabeth Warren,"Back in DC, but still thinking about my trip to Afghanistan. The Administration owes our troops a definition of victory &amp; plan to get there."
2453,Elizabeth Warren,Neomi Rao will help the Trump Admin toss out rules big business doesn’t like. I voted No on her nomination for OIRA.
2454,Elizabeth Warren,On my way to the floor to oppose Neomi Rao for head of the Office of Information &amp; Regulatory Affairs. Watch:
2455,Elizabeth Warren,Big business lobbyists will spend millions attacking the @CFPB’s arbitration rule. We must be ready to fight back.
2456,Elizabeth Warren,The @CFPB just issued a new rule that bans forced arbitration clauses &amp; lets families hold financial firms accountable when they’re cheated.
2457,Elizabeth Warren,"If a credit card company cheats you, it’s hard to hold them accountable. Financial contracts often block you from banding together in court."
2458,Elizabeth Warren,Every Senator – no matter the party – should step up and fight for the millions of babies like Peter who can’t speak for themselves.
2459,Elizabeth Warren,"At 10 years old, Liam wrote a letter to @realDonaldTrump about his mom’s fragile health. Liam’s voice is definitely one we need to hear:"
2460,Elizabeth Warren,Breast cancer and an auto-immune disease are hard enough on Jenny. She shouldn’t have to face bankruptcy trying to save her life.
2461,Elizabeth Warren,We filled 2 auditoriums &amp; still had folks waiting outside for our terrific Pittsfield town hall today. Thanks for making your voices heard!
2462,Elizabeth Warren,I’ll continue to think about what I saw this week in Afghanistan &amp; incorporate it into my work on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
2463,Elizabeth Warren,Nothing can take the place of seeing what is happening in the region with our own eyes &amp; speaking to the men &amp; women on the ground.
2464,Elizabeth Warren,I'm grateful to @SenJohnMcCain for organizing our bipartisan trip to Pakistan &amp; Afghanistan this week.
2465,Elizabeth Warren,"While they have taken positive steps, we told Pakistani leaders they must do more to eliminate safe havens &amp; terrorist groups in the region."
2466,Elizabeth Warren,"In South Waziristan, Army &amp; local leaders showed us how USAID's development projects are making a real difference in people's lives."
2467,Elizabeth Warren,I met with Pakistan Army Chief Gen. Bajwa to discuss the critical role Pakistan must play in countering terrorism in the region.
2468,Elizabeth Warren,I traveled to Pakistan this week with @SenJohnMcCain &amp; a bipartisan group of Senators to discuss counterterrorism &amp; security in the region.
2469,Elizabeth Warren,"@MassAGO @BetsyDeVosED Betsy DeVos might not like it, but her job is to serve students - &amp; if she won't do it, we will force her to do so."
2470,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, @MassAGO Healey is leading 18 states in a lawsuit to force @BetsyDeVosED to follow the law &amp; cancel the loans of cheated students."
2471,Elizabeth Warren,MA is challenging Betsy DeVos's illegal attempt to protect fly-by-night schools that cheat students &amp; bury them in mountains of debt.
2472,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenateGOP can wave their hands and say everyone will be fine – but here’s what will happen to our seniors if this bill passes.
2473,Elizabeth Warren,Less than .5% of Americans serve in our military. I recently asked Elizabeth Dole @DoleFoundation: how can we all support military families?
2474,Elizabeth Warren,Good news: Jessica &amp; Patrick's bipartisan bill to help domestic terrorism victims made it into the Senate defense bill last week.
2475,Elizabeth Warren,"Wishing everyone back in Massachusetts, across our country, &amp; far away from home a safe &amp; happy 4th of July celebration."
2476,Elizabeth Warren,I'm grateful to the men &amp; women who made this trip to Afghanistan possible.
2477,Elizabeth Warren,We also visited Forward Operating Base Gamberi to hear from the soldiers involved in training Afghan counterparts in Eastern Afghanistan.
2478,Elizabeth Warren,We had the opportunity to thank the Marine Security Guards who protect our Embassy in Kabul.
2479,Elizabeth Warren,"Our deployed troops are incredible, &amp; we got to participate in a promotion &amp; award ceremony for a group of them."
2480,Elizabeth Warren,Today I also got to have lunch with servicemembers from Massachusetts deployed to Afghanistan.
2481,Elizabeth Warren,We met with Afghanistan's top leaders in Kabul and received an operational update from General Nicholson and his team.
2482,Elizabeth Warren,"When General Nicholson, our Commanding General in Afghanistan, visited me in DC, I told him I'd like to return the favor."
2483,Elizabeth Warren,I’m honored to be spending this 4th of July visiting our troops in Afghanistan.
2484,Elizabeth Warren,"Great work, Minneapolis!"
2485,Elizabeth Warren,Health care pros want @SenateGOP to know: people without healthcare coverage are more likely to die than people with healthcare coverage.
2486,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenateMajLdr still intends to vote on this shameful healthcare bill. CEOs have stayed quiet. They must speak up.
2487,Elizabeth Warren,We must keep fighting to save the Affordable Care Act &amp; improve healthcare for American families.
2488,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenateMajLdr says he'll get the votes he needs to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It’s still up to us.
2489,Elizabeth Warren,But let’s be clear: The Republicans’ so-called “healthcare” bill comes back to life more often than the lead zombie in a horror movie.
2490,Elizabeth Warren,"People in MA &amp; across this country spoke out against this terrible ""healthcare"" bill. Today, you proved that you made your voices heard."
2491,Elizabeth Warren,I’m deeply relieved that @SenateMajLdr delayed a vote on the @SenateGOP's bill to rip health care away from 22 million Americans.
2492,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor to tell the @SenateGOP: It's not too late. Throw your “health care” plan in the trash.
2493,Elizabeth Warren,"I just got the latest numbers on the @SenateGOP ""health care"" bill — and there are 22 million reasons we need to fight it."
2494,Elizabeth Warren,This is a tax cut bill paid for by stealing billions from working people &amp; destroying health care for millions. Time to start over.
2495,Elizabeth Warren,"A bill that is opposed by the @AmerMedicalAssn because it will literally harm millions is not a ""health care"" bill."
2496,Elizabeth Warren,"A bill that kicks 22 million people off insurance to deliver $569 billion in tax giveaways to rich people is not a ""health care"" bill."
2497,Elizabeth Warren,Now we know why the @SenateGOP hid their monstrosity of a “health care” bill. 22 million people will lose their health insurance.
2498,Elizabeth Warren,What happens to preemies with complex medical needs in a world where the Senate “health care” bill passes?
2499,Elizabeth Warren,How could @SenateGOP propose cutting Medicaid for this child and the millions like him?
2500,Elizabeth Warren,This loving and hard-working family is what keeps me in this fight. Watch their story:
2501,Elizabeth Warren,What happens to grandma in a world where the Senate “health care” bill passes?
2502,Elizabeth Warren,"Congrats to you and Liz, @sethmoulton! Very happy for you both."
2503,Elizabeth Warren,The CEO of @BostonChildrens says the @SenateGOP bill is “rejection of our commitment to children &amp; their families.”
2504,Elizabeth Warren,MA has the best hospitals &amp; doctors in the country &amp; the world. Read what @MAHealthHosp says about the @SenateGOP healthcare bill.
2505,Elizabeth Warren,I’ve read the Republican “health care” bill. This is blood money. They’re paying for tax cuts with American lives.
2506,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor now to talk about the @SenateGOP's monstrosity of a so-called healthcare bill. Watch:
2507,Elizabeth Warren,Just got out of a Banking Committee hearing. Reading the @SenateGOP healthcare bill for the first time now. I'll share my thoughts soon.
2508,Elizabeth Warren,Women aren’t fools. We know the difference between reality &amp; lies. That’s why we’re fighting back to stop the @SenateGOP healthcare bill.
2509,Elizabeth Warren,"Rich is right: Workers will die if @realDonaldTrump rolls back protections for exposure to lethal, cancer-causing beryllium on the job."
2510,Elizabeth Warren,Speaking on the Senate floor about how 13 men are trading away women’s healthcare for tax cuts for the rich. Watch:
2511,Elizabeth Warren,"I’ll fight this mean, scary, reckless, shameful, heartless @SenateGOP healthcare bill every way I can."
2512,Elizabeth Warren,There’s a reason the @SenateGOP don’t want you to see their mean healthcare bill: they know it will hurt real people.
2513,Elizabeth Warren,Gutting funding for babies’ healthcare or seniors’ nursing homes is mean. Letting insurance companies drop cancer survivors is mean.
2514,Elizabeth Warren,But @realDonaldTrump is right: The GOP healthcare bill IS mean. Cutting healthcare for 23M people to give billionaires a tax break is mean.
2515,Elizabeth Warren,"Of all the words that @realDonaldTrump could pick, Trump called his healthcare plan “mean.” Mean for hard-working Americans."
2516,Elizabeth Warren,There are a lot of words that a President could use to describe their healthcare plan. Effective. Efficient. Comprehensive. Compassionate.
2517,Elizabeth Warren,"If you or someone you love needs Medicaid, we need to you to tell your story. The @SenateGOP need to hear you."
2518,Elizabeth Warren,Chantel &amp; Nicholas’ story moved me to my bones. Just watch – these are the hard-working people who would be devastated by Medicaid cuts.
2519,Elizabeth Warren,About to #holdthefloor with @SenateDems to share stories of MA families who need healthcare. Watch: https://t.co/E7dffRkTBd #ShowUsTheBill
2520,Elizabeth Warren,Starting hour three of @SenateDems fighting to #holdthefloor to stop Trumpcare. Watch live: https://t.co/0YypUAMNKS #ShowUsTheBill
2521,Elizabeth Warren,Tune in here to watch the Senate floor live as @SenateDems #holdthefloor to fight Trumpcare: https://t.co/0YypUAMNKS #ShowUsTheBill
2522,Elizabeth Warren,Health care for 23 million Americans is on the line in the next 2 weeks. Join @SenSanders &amp; me for this powerfully important discussion.
2523,Elizabeth Warren,The @federalreserve has the legal authority to hold the @WellsFargo Board accountable. It just needs the courage to do it.
2524,Elizabeth Warren,Today I called on the @federalreserve to remove all 12 @WellsFargo Board members who served during the scandal.
2525,Elizabeth Warren,5000 low-level @WellsFargo employees got fired. Not 1 Board member did. That's our screwed up corporate accountability system in a nutshell.
2526,Elizabeth Warren,.@WellsFargo’s Board did little while its low-level employees opened millions of fake accounts to meet their impossible sales quotas.
2527,Elizabeth Warren,2006: Bank CEO says it's safe to deregulate his bank2008: His bank gets $1.4B bailoutYesterday: He's back asking for deregulationWatch:
2528,Elizabeth Warren,This week I went to a @WSJ lunch of business execs &amp; told them to their faces: it’s time for you to step up on health care.
2529,Elizabeth Warren,Giant corporations are squealing for tax cuts – but they're not saying a word about the millions of people about to lose their health care.
2530,Elizabeth Warren,I’m glad @MassAGO Maura Healey has announced that she’ll fight @BetsyDeVosED &amp; this illegal delay in court.
2531,Elizabeth Warren,And Secretary DeVos made it nearly impossible for student cheated by #4profit schools to ever get out from under their massive debt burdens.
2532,Elizabeth Warren,Secretary DeVos made it easier &amp; more profitable for schools to swindle students while keeping their fraud hidden from courts.
2533,Elizabeth Warren,".@usedgov Sec @BetsyDeVosED put bogus #4profit colleges ahead of students, vets &amp; taxpayers by illegally delaying an Obama Admin rule."
2534,Elizabeth Warren,Today @SenatorCollins &amp; I introduced the Kensky &amp; Downes Act to help victims of terrorism access treatment at military facilities.
2535,Elizabeth Warren,Boston Marathon bombing victims Jessica Kensky &amp; Patrick Downes credit Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for their recoveries.
2536,Elizabeth Warren,"My thoughts are with @SteveScalise, all those injured, and the brave Capitol Police who protect us every day."
2537,Elizabeth Warren,"As our top law enforcement officer, the AG must be truthful and uphold the law. Sessions cannot continue to serve. He should resign."
2538,Elizabeth Warren,"If AG Sessions were truly recused, he should have had nothing to do with firing Comey. He promised to recuse. He broke that promise."
2539,Elizabeth Warren,"Today before Congress, AG Sessions refused to answer key questions about his discussions with @realDonaldTrump related to Comey’s firing."
2540,Elizabeth Warren,And now there’s talk that the Special Counsel now running the Russia investigation may be next on the chopping block. That’s bananas.
2541,Elizabeth Warren,"But even after recusing himself, Sessions recommended that the President fire FBI Director Comey – who was leading the Russia investigation."
2542,Elizabeth Warren,AG Sessions was forced to recuse himself from the Russia investigation after he lied to Congress about multiple meetings with the Russians.
2543,Elizabeth Warren,The @SenateDems women are speaking out now about the secret GOP plan to repeal ACA by the end of the month. WATCH:
2544,Elizabeth Warren,Jeff Sessions should have never been confirmed as Attorney General – and I’ve called for him to resign. #SessionsHearing
2545,Elizabeth Warren,AG Sessions lied to the Senate in January about his own contact with the Russians &amp; played a direct role in firing FBI Director Comey.
2546,Elizabeth Warren,Tune in here to watch AG Jeff Sessions' live testimony before the Senate Intel Committee: https://t.co/rR1S96bCep #SessionsHearing
2547,Elizabeth Warren,How do @SenateGOP expect us to talk about prescription costs when they’re secretly writing a plan to throw millions off their health care?!
2548,Elizabeth Warren,"Read my @BostonGlobe op-ed about how we fought for a conflict of interest rule for retirement advisers, &amp; won."
2549,Elizabeth Warren,Saving for retirement is hard enough. The last thing families need is to worry if their financial adviser has their best interests in mind.
2550,Elizabeth Warren,"In a matchup between @realDonaldTrump’s #MuslimBan &amp; the Constitution, my money’s on the Constitution every time. The 9th Circuit agrees."
2551,Elizabeth Warren,I LOVE the Boston Pride Parade. It shows our Commonwealth and our country at its best.
2552,Elizabeth Warren,"I couldn't have said it better myself, @clairecmc."
2553,Elizabeth Warren,Here’s a little hint for the @HouseGOP: NOBODY silences Democratic Leader @NancyPelosi. #NeverthelessShePersisted
2554,Elizabeth Warren,Hundreds of thousands of you stood up to the lobbyists for the conflict of interest rule &amp; we won. Today we celebrate. THANK YOU.
2555,Elizabeth Warren,"For years, we’ve fought for a basic rule: retirement advisers should have to put their customers’ interests first. Today, that’s the law."
2556,Elizabeth Warren,"Congratulations, Ambassador @SenScottBrown! Best wishes to you &amp; Gail in New Zealand. I know you’ll make us proud."
2557,Elizabeth Warren,I’m going to fight my heart out to protect Wall Street reform &amp; the @CFPB. I urge the Senate: Enough with the Wall Street handouts.
2558,Elizabeth Warren,.@HouseDemocrats unanimously opposed the #WrongChoiceAct. Dems will keep fighting for working families while the GOP works for Wall St.
2559,Elizabeth Warren,Financial companies pour money into Washington. Their lobbyists swarm the place. The @HouseGOP’s #WrongChoiceAct is their reward.
2560,Elizabeth Warren,"Veterans, seniors, &amp; consumers all oppose the @HouseGOP’s #WrongChoiceAct. Know who doesn’t? Big banks &amp; payday lenders."
2561,Elizabeth Warren,Let me repeat: The @HouseGOP voted today to make it nearly impossible to hold big banks accountable for cheating you. #WrongChoiceAct
2562,Elizabeth Warren,"While everyone was watching Comey today, the @HouseGOP just voted to gut the rules on Wall Street. #WrongChoiceAct"
2563,Elizabeth Warren,A hostile foreign gov used a dangerous weapon to undermine our democracy. We must set aside politics &amp; make certain it never happens again.
2564,Elizabeth Warren,"No matter who @realDonaldTrump threatens, intimidates, or fires, it’s the job of law enforcement &amp; Congress to get to the bottom of this."
2565,Elizabeth Warren,"Comey’s sworn testimony today paints a picture of a President only interested in protecting himself, his aides, &amp; his friends from the law."
2566,Elizabeth Warren,The first job of the President of the United States – the first job – is to protect this nation from threats.
2567,Elizabeth Warren,"There’s no question this is a powerfully important moment for the Senate, the Trump-Russia investigation, our rule of law, &amp; our democracy."
2568,Elizabeth Warren,Tune in here to watch former FBI Director Comey’s live testimony before the Senate Intel Committee: https://t.co/nvAwspDgjP #ComeyDay
2569,Elizabeth Warren,@ColorOfChange @ACLU It’s time to remove the profit motive from our justice system &amp; focus on solutions that make our communities stronger &amp; safer.
2570,Elizabeth Warren,Insightful report from @ColorofChange &amp; @ACLU about how the for-profit bail industry traps people in jail &amp; debt.
2571,Elizabeth Warren,Read FBI Director Comey's testimony for tomorrow's hearing. This whole thing is crazy.
2572,Elizabeth Warren,"Silencing @SenKamalaHarris for not being “courteous” enough is just unbelievable. Keep fighting, Kamala! #NeverthelessShePersisted"
2573,Elizabeth Warren,"Democrats stand with veterans, seniors, &amp; working families to oppose the #wrongchoiceact. We won’t let Wall Street crush our economy again."
2574,Elizabeth Warren,"Dems remember the 2008 crash. We remember the millions who lost their jobs, homes, &amp; life savings because of Wall Street’s reckless greed."
2575,Elizabeth Warren,"Consumer groups, civil rights groups, veterans groups – everyone who’s not a big bank – opposes the GOP #wrongchoiceact."
2576,Elizabeth Warren,"Despite all his tough talk on Wall Street, @realDonaldTrump is proudly supporting the #wrongchoiceact to “undo” Dodd-Frank."
2577,Elizabeth Warren,The @HouseGOP are ramming through a bill this week to roll back Wall Street reform &amp; gut the @CFPB. #wrongchoiceact
2578,Elizabeth Warren,Take a look at the faces of @realDonaldTrump’s proposed cuts to the education budget:
2579,Elizabeth Warren,"A group of Massachusetts women came by the Senate to fight back against Trumpcare – and they inspire me to keep fighting, too."
2580,Elizabeth Warren,"At town halls across MA, people ask me how to fight back &amp; keep fighting back. Here's the thing about democracy: It's up to all of us."
2581,Elizabeth Warren,"Way to go, Boston!"
2582,Elizabeth Warren,America’s new chief banking regulator used to be the person defending big banks. @ChrisVanHollen and I blow the whistle on this scandal.
2583,Elizabeth Warren,"Today I’m launching #DeVosWatch, a new oversight effort to hold @BetsyDeVosEd &amp; @usedgov accountable. Watch:"
2584,Elizabeth Warren,It’s @BetsyDeVosED’s job to put students – not predatory colleges and the student loan industry – first.
2585,Elizabeth Warren,The recent Trump-DeVos education budget upends the student loan program &amp; makes it harder to afford college.
2586,Elizabeth Warren,But so far what has @BetsyDeVosED done? She’s hired advisers tied to shady for-profit colleges &amp; made it easier to cheat students.
2587,Elizabeth Warren,"As Education Secretary, @BetsyDeVosED controls the $1T student loan program – a massive responsibility."
2588,Elizabeth Warren,"Selling out to these corporations might be @realDonaldTrump’s style, but we must do better as a nation and tackle climate change head-on."
2589,Elizabeth Warren,"Now, @realDonaldTrump is about to surrender U.S. climate leadership on the world stage by pulling out of the Paris Agreement."
2590,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump and his team have given one handout after another to Big Oil and Big Coal since taking office.
2591,Elizabeth Warren,Let’s honor those who sacrificed for our country by strengthening our promises to servicemembers &amp; their families.
2592,Elizabeth Warren,Today we remember &amp; honor the men &amp; women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country &amp; all those who love them. #MemorialDay
2593,Elizabeth Warren,.@realdonaldtrump's budget would impose deep cuts to opioid crisis funding. We can't let this budget be the final word.
2594,Elizabeth Warren,Lifting the @US_FDA hiring freeze won't matter if @realDonaldTrump's budget slashes FDA funding 30% &amp; cuts jobs. We need an effective FDA.
2595,Elizabeth Warren,Good news: Commissioner Gottlieb announced that @US_FDA will no longer be subject to the hiring freeze.
2596,Elizabeth Warren,I wrote to @US_FDA about the dangerous hiring freeze in January &amp; again last month.
2597,Elizabeth Warren,"The @US_FDA is an important cop on the beat, &amp; I've been worried about the impact of @realDonaldTrump's gov hiring freeze on the agency."
2598,Elizabeth Warren,Breaking news: @realDonaldTrump's illegal &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban is still illegal &amp; unconstitutional.
2599,Elizabeth Warren,@realDonaldTrump I’m heading to the Senate floor now to discuss Trumpcare’s devastating impact on working families. Watch:
2600,Elizabeth Warren,And @realDonaldTrump’s indefensible budget &amp; unforgivable Trumpcare bill cuts the money needed to fight our country’s opioid crisis.
2601,Elizabeth Warren,The GOP Trumpcare plan is as clear as it is cruel: destroy health care for tens of millions in order to give tax cuts to rich people.
2602,Elizabeth Warren,"We need more investments in NIH, not less. I’ll fight for MA &amp; oppose these misguided cuts for scientific research."
2603,Elizabeth Warren,My new report shows: NIH funding is critical for MA scientists. But @realDonaldTrump wants to cut NIH by $5.7B. https://t.co/U3r8Su4kWb
2604,Elizabeth Warren,MA researchers are curing diseases &amp; developing new tech that is driving our economy &amp; helping millions live healthier lives.
2605,Elizabeth Warren,Our government should work for everyone – not just millionaires &amp; billionaires. We can fight back by rejecting Judge Thapar’s nomination.
2606,Elizabeth Warren,"There are many reasons to oppose Judge Thapar’s nom for the Sixth Circuit, but one should concern everyone: his money in politics."
2607,Elizabeth Warren,"Like Judge Gorsuch, Judge Amul Thapar made the list of 21 “acceptable” judges that far-right groups handed to Donald Trump."
2608,Elizabeth Warren,Watch @RepKClark . @usedgov Secretary Betsy DeVos’s answer – or lack of one – is horrifying.
2609,Elizabeth Warren,"This isn’t just about economics, it’s about our values. Health care is a basic human right, &amp; @SenateDems WILL fight back to stop Trumpcare."
2610,Elizabeth Warren,The numbers don’t lie here: this new version of Trumpcare will still bankrupt American families. People will die.
2611,Elizabeth Warren,"Trumpcare is devastating for the poor. Seniors. Pregnant women. People w/ pre-existing conditions, mental health &amp; substance use disorders."
2612,Elizabeth Warren,The CBO confirmed: Trumpcare is a $663 BILLION tax cut for the rich paid for by kicking 23 MILLION people off of insurance. End of story.
2613,Elizabeth Warren,"We should be expanding Social Security, not cutting it. We won’t let the GOP dismantle Social Security inch by inch with this budget."
2614,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump promised not to cut Social Security. I’ve looked at the budget, &amp; here it is: $73B in Social Security cuts."
2615,Elizabeth Warren,Trumpcare isn’t a health care plan – it’s a cruel joke. We need to fight back with everything we have to make sure it never becomes reality.
2616,Elizabeth Warren,"Under Trumpcare, 445k MA residents would lose healthcare. We’d lose $10B in state funding. And out-of-pocket costs would skyrocket."
2617,Elizabeth Warren,A new analysis out today shows: Trumpcare will hit Massachusetts like a sledgehammer.
2618,Elizabeth Warren,"When we fight, we can win. I’m going to keep on fighting any attempts to weaken, undermine, or kill the @USDOL conflict of interest rule."
2619,Elizabeth Warren,@BarackObama @USDOL We can’t let our guard down. The Trump Admin &amp; giant financial firms made it clear: they'll try to roll back this rule as soon as they can.
2620,Elizabeth Warren,@BarackObama @USDOL Good news: We put a stop to the predatory conflicts of interest that cost Americans saving for retirement $17B/yr.
2621,Elizabeth Warren,I was w/ @BarackObama as he rolled out @USDOL’s rule for retirement advisers. The financial firms tried everything to delay &amp; kill the rule.
2622,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump’s @usedgov budget is an all-out assault on America’s kids, teachers, college students &amp; student loan borrowers."
2623,Elizabeth Warren,I love speaking at MA graduations. Watch highlights from @umassamherst.
2624,Elizabeth Warren,"@senorrinhatch @SenWhitehouse The bipartisan College Transparency Act will give students, families, &amp; policymakers an accurate pic of how colleges serve their students."
2625,Elizabeth Warren,"I intro'd the College Transparency Act w/ @senorrinhatch, Bill Cassidy &amp; @SenWhitehouse to patch college data gaps:"
2626,Elizabeth Warren,"@usedgov .@USedgov makes colleges report completion data only for 1st time, full-time students – not students that switch schools or go part-time."
2627,Elizabeth Warren,"Students need accurate, comprehensive info to pick the right college, but the data @USedgov requires colleges to report is old &amp; incomplete."
2628,Elizabeth Warren,Congrats @WheelockCollege grads! I’m honored to join you for commencement today. Friends &amp; family can watch live:
2629,Elizabeth Warren,@realDonaldTrump @USTreasury Watch this totally bizarre testimony from @USTreasury Sec Mnuchin where he admits he doesn’t support Glass-Steagall.
2630,Elizabeth Warren,"@realDonaldTrump Now that @realDonaldTrump &amp; @USTreasury Sec Mnuchin have met with the Wall Street lobbyists, they’ve done a complete 180 on Glass-Steagall."
2631,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump has claimed for months that he supports reinstating Glass-Steagall - the law separating commercial &amp; investment banking.
2632,Elizabeth Warren,"As Mueller steps up to enforce the law, Congress must step up too – with its own independent, bipartisan, &amp; transparent investigations."
2633,Elizabeth Warren,"For Mr. Mueller to succeed, he needs total authority to pursue this investigation – completely free of any hint of political interference."
2634,Elizabeth Warren,"It is obvious to the American people that the Russia-Trump investigation requires a special counsel, &amp; I am glad we finally have one."
2635,Elizabeth Warren,"Heading to the Senate floor to oppose DOJ nominee Rachel Brand, &amp; reintroduce my #BankonStudents refi bill. Watch:"
2636,Elizabeth Warren,.@MartinHeinrich &amp; I urged @TheJusticeDept IG to investigate/report on Sessions’ role in Comey’s firing. https://t.co/3GwjA4TUX2
2637,Elizabeth Warren,AG Sessions didn’t just decide to recuse himself because he’s a nice guy. @TheJusticeDept regulations require it.
2638,Elizabeth Warren,"Sessions played a role in firing FBI Director Comey – a firing @realDonaldTrump said was, in part, based on Comey’s Russia investigation."
2639,Elizabeth Warren,"After getting caught lying about contact with the Russians, Sessions said he’d recused himself from the Trump-Russia investigation."
2640,Elizabeth Warren,@realDonaldTrump @FCC Powerful companies shouldn’t decide how or when we use the internet. That’s why we have to fight back to defend #NetNeutrality.
2641,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump’s @FCC votes tomorrow to gut #NetNeutrality rules that keep the internet free &amp; open, &amp; hand control to big broadband."
2642,Elizabeth Warren,Sending my best wishes to @SenThomTillis &amp; his family this morning. Hope you have a very speedy recovery!
2643,Elizabeth Warren,@SenatorLankford The bipartisan #TruthinSettlements Act passed unanimously through the Senate in the last Congress. It’s time to make this happen.
2644,Elizabeth Warren,Today @SenatorLankford &amp; I reintroduced our #TruthinSettlements Act to shut down the backroom deal making:
2645,Elizabeth Warren,"Settlements may be tax deductible or have credits hidden in fine print. If the gov is going to cut deals, we should know what we’re getting."
2646,Elizabeth Warren,"When the federal gov reaches a settlement with companies that break the law, they tout a big $ amount. But those numbers can be misleading."
2647,Elizabeth Warren,Wishing all my best for a speedy recovery to my dear friend @maziehirono. Your Senate family is here for you every step of the way!

2667,Elizabeth Warren,"We had a smart, thoughtful, bipartisan, &amp; packed town hall in Ware last night. Very grateful to the hundreds of people who joined us."

2669,Elizabeth Warren,Honored to speak at the @UMassAmherst graduation ceremony this afternoon! #umass2017
2670,Elizabeth Warren,The GOP spent yrs gutting voting rights &amp; suppressing black &amp; Latino votes. We can’t allow @realDonaldTrump to turn the clocks back more.
2671,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump picked Kris Kobach – architect of some of the most racist &amp; anti-voter state laws – to lead this new conspiracy crusade.
2672,Elizabeth Warren,"Today @realDonaldTrump signed an order launching a ""Vote Fraud Commission,"" but it really should be called a ""Vote Intimidation Commission."""
2673,Elizabeth Warren,"So @realDonaldTrump is taking his make-believe, fact-free stories of voter fraud to a whole new level."
2674,Elizabeth Warren,"Russia tried to influence our election, &amp; @realDonaldTrump just fired the top Russia investigator. But Trump wants to change the subject."
2675,Elizabeth Warren,".@TheJusticeDept Stop hiding behind spokespeople. Rosenstein must testify, under oath, at @senjudiciary on his mtgs with @realDonaldTrump &amp; Director Comey."
2676,Elizabeth Warren,.@TheJusticeDept NYT says Comey asked Rosenstein for more resources for Russia investigation – right before firing. DOJ denies.
2677,Elizabeth Warren,I voted against Rod Rosenstein’s nomination to the #2 spot at @TheJusticeDept because he refused to commit to a special prosecutor.
2678,Elizabeth Warren,I spoke to @allinwithchris about why we need an independent prosecutor to investigate Trump's ties to Russia. Watch.
2679,Elizabeth Warren,In just a few minutes I'll be discussing FBI Director Comey with @allinwithchris. Tune in. #inners
2680,Elizabeth Warren,"We need a real, independent prosecutor who @realDonaldTrump can't fire, Sessions can't intimidate, &amp; Congress can't muzzle. We need it now."
2681,Elizabeth Warren,It’s time for Congress to get their heads out of the sand. @realDonaldTrump cannot pick the person to continue this critical investigation.
2682,Elizabeth Warren,But does anyone seriously believe @realDonaldTrump fired the top person investigating his ties to Russia because he was unfair to Hillary?
2683,Elizabeth Warren,There’s no question that Comey made questionable decisions during the election. The FBI shouldn’t comment on ongoing investigations.
2684,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump Today I urged the CFTC, SEC &amp; EPA to investigate Trump adviser Carl Icahn for insider trading &amp; market manipulation. https://t.co/LfdBJQRBqW"
2685,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump Icahn made a big bet that the price of renewable fuel credits would drop. Then he advised on policies that made them drop. Icahn made $50M.
2686,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump named Carl Icahn as his special adviser – even though Icahn is still majority owner of a petroleum refining company.
2687,Elizabeth Warren,".@HouseGOP Watch @SenDuckworth, @SenBillNelson, @SenatorTester &amp; @SenBlumenthal explain: we owe it to vets to stop Trumpcare."
2688,Elizabeth Warren,The @HouseGOP’s Trumpcare plan would be devastating for vets in MA &amp; across the country who rely on ACA tax credits to pay for health care.
2689,Elizabeth Warren,"The @HouseGOP just voted to strip health care away from millions. We can whimper, we can whine – or we can fight back. #AHCA"
2690,Elizabeth Warren,Health care is a basic human right. We’ll fight as long &amp; hard as we can to make that a reality for everyone in America. #AHCA
2691,Elizabeth Warren,"Disease, sickness, old age touches every family. Tragedy doesn’t ask who you voted for. #AHCA"
2692,Elizabeth Warren,This isn’t football. It’s not about scoring points. #AHCA will devastate Americans’ healthcare. Families will go bankrupt. People will die.
2693,Elizabeth Warren,The only thing that’s changed about Trumpcare is that @HouseGOP made the original plan even more brutal. #AHCA
2694,Elizabeth Warren,This Trumpcare bill still rips funds away from states like Massachusetts that are battling the opioid crisis. #AHCA
2695,Elizabeth Warren,This is the same cruel Trumpcare bill that @HouseGOP tried to pass weeks ago. Still strips coverage from millions &amp; guts Medicaid. #AHCA
2696,Elizabeth Warren,Trumpcare isn’t a health care bill. A bill that destroys health care for millions to shovel cash to the rich isn’t a health care bill. #AHCA
2697,Elizabeth Warren,Aggressive negotiations can yield good results – including $100 million to fight the opioid epidemic.

2700,Elizabeth Warren,Republicans are voting on a bill that would pull the rug out from under state retirement plans. Why? The @USChamber likes the system rigged.
2701,Elizabeth Warren,55 million Americans don’t have access to a workplace retirement account – so states have stepped up to provide these savings accounts.
2702,Elizabeth Warren,.@HouseGOP can keep picking the side of big banks like Wells Fargo over servicemembers &amp; vets – but Dems side with vets &amp; working families.
2703,Elizabeth Warren,Every @FinancialCmte R also voted to take away the authority that the @CFPB used to hold Wells Fargo accountable for the fake accounts scam.
2704,Elizabeth Warren,Preserving the @CFPB’s independent funding is critical – including to the vets &amp; servicemembers it protects.
2705,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, every single Republican on the House @FinancialCmte voted to cut off the @CFPB’s independent funding."
2706,Elizabeth Warren,The @HouseGOP are lining up behind a rotten bill to gut the @CFPB – but @HouseDemocrats are fighting back.
2707,Elizabeth Warren,There is no place for bigotry in the US Army. Dr Mark Green’s comments disqualify him from leadership.
2708,Elizabeth Warren,Our military force's diversity is its greatest strength. The Army Secretary must show genuine support for ALL of our men &amp; women in uniform.
2709,Elizabeth Warren,"Muslims, Latinos, &amp; LGBTQ Americans protect our country. They’re part of service member families. They’re part of our great American family."
2710,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump’s nominee for Army Secretary – Dr Mark Green – has made hateful &amp; ignorant comments about our fellow Americans.
2711,Elizabeth Warren,".@HouseGOP @FSCDems The GOP may want to forget the devastating financial crisis that crashed the economy, but the American people haven’t – and neither will we."
2712,Elizabeth Warren,.@HouseGOP Today @FSCDems are standing firm against the #WrongCHOICEAct that rolls back Wall Street reform. Dems will fight back every step of the way.
2713,Elizabeth Warren,Big banks are salivating over @HouseGOP’s Financial CHOICE Act. But this bill is nothing more than a 589-page insult to working families.
2714,Elizabeth Warren,.@HouseGOP Americans are fed up with a Washington that works great for giant companies but kicks hardworking people in the teeth.
2715,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, @HouseGOP are voting to make it legal for employers to cheat workers out of overtime. It's a disgrace."
2716,Elizabeth Warren,"With working families across the country scraping to make ends meet, Congress should strengthen protections for workers - not gut them."
2717,Elizabeth Warren,That’s the Trump Admin in a nutshell: Rich guys making each other richer &amp; patting themselves on the back. Gross.
2718,Elizabeth Warren,I’ve introduced a bipartisan bill with Sen. Rubio to help cut off human traffickers’ access to the banking system:
2719,Elizabeth Warren,"Human trafficking is an ugly stain on humanity, and we need to use every possible tool to stop it."
2720,Elizabeth Warren,Dozens of incredible kids at Clarke Middle School wrote letters to me about climate change – here's my message back to them.
2721,Elizabeth Warren,Tomorrow is National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. Safely dispose of unused pills at a collection site near you:
2722,Elizabeth Warren,"Almost 80% of people at high risk for prescription drug overdose are using opioids legally prescribed to themselves, family, or friends."
2723,Elizabeth Warren,These deaths are another reminder that Washington must do better by working families. Step one: opposing @POTUS's proposed cuts to OSHA.
2724,Elizabeth Warren,A new report shows that 70 Massachusetts workers — from ages 18-74 — lost their lives on the job in 2016 alone:
2725,Elizabeth Warren,Today is Workers’ Memorial Day—the 46th birthday of OSHA and a chance to honor workers who have died on the job.
2726,Elizabeth Warren,".@HouseGOP @RepHensarling @CFPB Hey @RepHensarling: ""I know you are but what am I"" doesn't work with adults. Americans oppose your plan to gut Wall Street reform."
2727,Elizabeth Warren,.@HouseGOP @RepHensarling @CFPB .@RepHensarling even says Wall Street CEOs LOVE Dodd-Frank and that I'm their ally. Ask the ex-CEO of Wells Fargo about that.
2728,Elizabeth Warren,.@HouseGOP @RepHensarling The @CFPB forced banks to return $12B to consumers they cheated. But @RepHensarling says Wall Street HATES his plan to kill CFPB. What?!
2729,Elizabeth Warren,".@HouseGOP .@RepHensarling spent yrs trying to kill fin reform, but he says his bill to destroy it actually PROTECTS consumers &amp; FIGHTS Wall St. Huh?!"
2730,Elizabeth Warren,".@HouseGOP don't like me calling them out, so now they want you to think their plan to gut fin reform actually holds Wall St accountable!"
2731,Elizabeth Warren,"This AM, I told @FinancialCmte their bill to neuter consumer protection &amp; unleash bad behavior on Wall St is immoral"
2732,Elizabeth Warren,Wall St spent over $1M a DAY trying to kill financial reform after the '08 crisis—we still passed it. Now @HouseGOP is back to try &amp; kill it
2733,Elizabeth Warren,The test of a @USDOL nominee is simple: will you stand up for 150 million US workers? Acosta failed this basic test.
2734,Elizabeth Warren,Real tax reform would close up loopholes for the rich &amp; put working families first.
2735,Elizabeth Warren,"America's biggest corporations have stashed over $2.6 trillion in profits offshore, &amp; @realDonaldTrump wants to give them a tax cut."
2736,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump wants billionaires &amp; giant corporations to pay lower taxes &amp; leave scraps for working families.
2737,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump ran 4 companies through bankruptcy. Now he plans to bankrupt our country.
2738,Elizabeth Warren,"Yesterday, a court blocked @realDonaldTrump’s order. Trump may not like it, but the Constitution applies to him too."
2739,Elizabeth Warren,"Months ago, I wrote to federal agencies explaining why this executive order violates the constitution."
2740,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump’s executive order is immoral, unconstitutional, and dangerous for MA families."
2741,Elizabeth Warren,But @realDonaldTrump issued an executive order to cut off this federal grant money for cities with immigration policies he doesn’t like.
2742,Elizabeth Warren,"MA pays more in taxes than we get back in federal dollars, but that money is critical for opioid treatment, homelessness prevention, &amp; more."
2743,Elizabeth Warren,Our MA state senators are worried about @realdonaldtrump's budget cuts for their communities. Glad to hear their concerns in DC today.
2744,Elizabeth Warren,No surprise here that MA has the best teacher in the US. Congrats to 2017 National Teacher of the Year Sydney Chaffee from Codman Academy!
2745,Elizabeth Warren,Shareholders should vote out every member of the @WellsFargo’s board who was around during this scam. This is about accountability.
2746,Elizabeth Warren,Either @WellsFargo’s board failed to fully investigate the fraud for years or they knew about it and did nothing – either is unacceptable.
2747,Elizabeth Warren,Today I released a letter from @WellsFargo’s auditor showing the board knew of improper sales practices for years:
2748,Elizabeth Warren,.@WellsFargo’s shareholders get to decide if they will hold their board accountable for their bank’s fraud or just give them a free pass.
2749,Elizabeth Warren,"For the 1st time since the @CFPB caught @WellsFargo opening millions of fake accounts for customers, the bank’s shareholders meet today."
2750,Elizabeth Warren,I have just one promise: we will not forget. #ArmenianGenocide
2751,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump’s actions in his first 100 days have shown his tough talk against Wall Street and big corporations was just that: all talk
2752,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump Then @realDonaldTrump ordered a review of tax rules corporations find “burdensome,” like a crackdown on tax-dodging corporate inversions."
2753,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump Yesterday, @realDonaldTrump signed orders that could make it harder to rein in ""too big to fail"" financial firms."
2754,Elizabeth Warren,"Candidate @realDonaldTrump talked a big game about standing up to Wall Street &amp; big companies that stash profits overseas. (Yeah, right.)"
2755,Elizabeth Warren,Way to go Sydney! Thanks for all you do for Massachusetts students
2756,Elizabeth Warren,Congrats @SenScottBrown on your nomination for New Zealand Ambassador! You have my support &amp; I'm sure you'll make the people of MA proud.
2757,Elizabeth Warren,"On #OneBostonDay, Boston asks everyone to participate in acts of kindness &amp; service. Join us &amp; learn more at"
2758,Elizabeth Warren,"Saturday is the 4-yr anniv of the Marathon bombings. We remember the victims of that tragedy, but also the generosity of many in its wake."
2759,Elizabeth Warren,Another terrific town hall in Salem tonight! Glad to answer people's questions &amp; talk about how I'm fighting for MA families in the Senate.
2760,Elizabeth Warren,"In the choice between students &amp; student loan companies, Betsy DeVos made clear she stands with companies that cheat &amp; squeeze borrowers."
2761,Elizabeth Warren,.@usedgov Yet another gut punch to struggling student loan borrowers. And another reason we need the @CFPB to protect students when @usedgov fails.
2762,Elizabeth Warren,"Make no mistake: Betsy DeVos &amp; @usedgov just gave a big wet kiss to Navient, which pushed students into bad loans."
2763,Elizabeth Warren,.@usedgov DeVos rolled back protections that make it harder for student loan companies that cheat borrowers to keep raking in gov contracts.
2764,Elizabeth Warren,.@usedgov Secretary Betsy DeVos just ripped up policies created last year to protect student loan borrowers.
2765,Elizabeth Warren,.@CFPB @WellsFargo The @SEC_News &amp; @TheJusticeDept should use all the tools they have to hold Stumpf &amp; @WellsFargo execs accountable under the law.
2766,Elizabeth Warren,".@CFPB @WellsFargo .@WellsFargo’s clawback is a good step, but an internal investigation is no substitute for a thorough gov investigation into the scam."
2767,Elizabeth Warren,".@CFPB @WellsFargo The @WellsFargo board just clawed back another $75M from 2 execs, including fmr CEO Stumpf."
2768,Elizabeth Warren,"After the @CFPB helped bring to light the fake accounts scandal at @WellsFargo, the bank’s Board launched an internal investigation."
2769,Elizabeth Warren,"If @realDonaldTrump truly wants to help Syrians fleeing murderers, he should drop his effort to ban their children from America immediately."
2770,Elizabeth Warren,"Congress must demand an actual strategy, clear goals, and a plan for achieving them before approving additional military action in Syria."
2771,Elizabeth Warren,The President's erratic approach to Syria is not a strategy. It underscores why our Constitution doesn't let Presidents wage war alone.
2772,Elizabeth Warren,"Within a week, Trump's Admin went from asserting they wouldn't intervene to launching Tomahawk missiles against Assad. That's erratic."
2773,Elizabeth Warren,We need a plan to hold Assad accountable. But so far I’ve seen no compelling strategic justification for Trump's missile strike.
2774,Elizabeth Warren,Glass-Steagall has bipartisan support: from @SenSanders to @realDonaldTrump; both @TheDemocrats &amp; @RNC platforms. Let’s get this done.
2775,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, @SenJohnMcCain, @SenatorCantwell, @SenAngusKing &amp; I are reintroducing the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act. https://t.co/rgk4w2s6QO"
2776,Elizabeth Warren,"Glass-Steagall was one of the 1st bills I introduced in the Senate 4 yrs ago with @SenJohnMcCain, @SenatorCantwell &amp; @SenAngusKing."
2777,Elizabeth Warren,"If bankers want to go gamble with complex financial products, ok – but they shouldn’t do it with the money in grandma’s checking account."
2778,Elizabeth Warren,But let’s get real: Most of the big banks are even bigger now than when we declared them “too big to fail” in 2008 &amp; bailed them out.
2779,Elizabeth Warren,We’ve made some real progress since Wall Street’s high-risk bets brought our economy to its knees.
2780,Elizabeth Warren,"If ever we needed a strong, independent Supreme Court with broad public support, it’s now. Rules change or not, we’ll keep fighting for it."
2781,Elizabeth Warren,"The GOP will be responsible for every 5-4 decision that throws working Americans under the bus to favor the powerful, moneyed few."
2782,Elizabeth Warren,The GOP will have to own every 5-4 case that opens the floodgates even more to secret spending in our political system.
2783,Elizabeth Warren,"The GOP will have to own every 5-4 attack on women’s rights, voting rights, LGBT rights, &amp; freedom of speech &amp; religion."
2784,Elizabeth Warren,"Changing the rules to jam through a right-wing, corporate-owned judge means the GOP will have to own the Gorsuch Court."
2785,Elizabeth Warren,"I get that the GOP won’t pick a progressive. But if a SCOTUS nominee isn’t mainstream enough for 60 votes, he/she shouldn’t be confirmed."
2786,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenJeffMerkley @DunkinDonuts .@SenJeffMerkley is one of the best, and I’m very glad to fight side-by-side with him. #StopGorsuch #holdthefloor"
2787,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenJeffMerkley I thought @SenJeffMerkley’s staff might need a sugar boost, so with Jeff on the phone, I dropped off @DunkinDonuts to his office."
2788,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenJeffMerkley  is a champion for working families – and he showed it overnight when he spoke for more than 15 hours about Judge Gorsuch.
2789,Elizabeth Warren,"Go, @SenJeffMerkley, Go! #StopGorsuch #HoldTheFloor"
2790,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump I’m heading to the Senate floor now to discuss why I oppose Neil Gorsuch &amp; why he should not be confirmed:
2791,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s clear that @realDonaldTrump’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, doesn’t have enough support in the Senate to be confirmed."
2792,Elizabeth Warren,.@VP On the Senate floor now to fight for Title X &amp; women’s health care centers. Watch:
2793,Elizabeth Warren,"Title X is a bipartisan program to provide birth control, cancer screenings &amp; HIV tests, &amp; @VP Pence cast the tiebreaking vote attacking it"
2794,Elizabeth Warren,The GOP vote attacking family planning may deadlock. Will Trump really haul in @mike_pence to cast a historic vote against women’s health?
2795,Elizabeth Warren,About to speak on the Senate floor on how GOP will vote soon to make it harder for people save for retirement:
2796,Elizabeth Warren,I #StandWithPP because millions of women in MA &amp; across this country depend on Planned Parenthood for basic medical care. #PinkOut
2797,Elizabeth Warren,The @CapitolPolice do heroic work keeping our visitors &amp; staff in DC safe. We thank them today &amp; every day.
2798,Elizabeth Warren,Speaking on the Senate floor about how @realDonaldTrump still threatens to sabotage Americans’ health care. Watch:
2799,Elizabeth Warren,"This is why we fight. When we get out there &amp; fight, we can make a real difference."
2800,Elizabeth Warren,But I'm not doing a touchdown dance today. Not when the GOP is still hell-bent on rigging the system for the rich &amp; powerful.
2801,Elizabeth Warren,Today is a great day for the people of Massachusetts &amp; people across the country who depend on the Affordable Care Act.
2802,Elizabeth Warren,"The truth will come out, @GOP. Get on the right side of history before it's too late."
2803,Elizabeth Warren,"The idea that Devin Nunes will investigate Trump/Russia is a farce. It's time for a real, independent, transparent inquiry."
2804,Elizabeth Warren,The FBI is investigating collusion between @realDonaldTrump's campaign &amp; Russia. When will the GOP end the charade &amp; put country first?
2805,Elizabeth Warren,"Meanwhile, reports today say @realDonaldTrump's campaign manager was paid millions to help Putin influence US politics. Drip. Drip. Drip."
2806,Elizabeth Warren,"After slamming leaks as ""criminal,"" Devin Nunes is now privately briefing @realDonaldTrump - even leaking info to help him."
2807,Elizabeth Warren,Who does House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes think he works for: the American people or @realDonaldTrump?
2808,Elizabeth Warren,The @SenateGOP would undo @FCC rules &amp; let internet service providers sell private info without telling
2809,Elizabeth Warren,"Now the @SenateGOP is obsessed with using the Congressional Review Act to kill every consumer protection rule in sight, like the @FCC rules."
2810,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenMarkey is right: the @FCC protected consumers by adopting #BroadbandPrivacy rules – on how companies collect/use/share/sell our data.
2811,Elizabeth Warren,Massachusetts Sec of State Galvin is right to be worried: @realDonaldTrump's bigotry &amp; hate could greatly influence our census results.
2812,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor now to talk about @realDonaldTrump’s efforts to cut OSHA safety for workers. Watch:
2813,Elizabeth Warren,The FBI Director testified @realDonaldTrump's campaign is under investigation for collusion w/ Russia. Lifetime court appointments can wait.
2814,Elizabeth Warren,But is the Senate really going to pretend there's no cloud over @realDonaldTrump &amp; move on w/ the Gorsuch nomination like things are normal?
2815,Elizabeth Warren,I've strongly opposed the Gorsuch nomination. Giant companies don't need another Supreme Court justice to tilt the law in their favor.
2816,Elizabeth Warren,Neil Gorsuch is up for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court from a President whose campaign is under FBI investigation.
2817,Elizabeth Warren,"Instead of siding with the big banks, the @HouseGOP should join @HouseDemocrats in ensuring that the @CFPB remains a strong cop on the beat."
2818,Elizabeth Warren,"Today, the GOP @FinancialCmte has a hearing about “restructuring” the @CFPB – another way of saying they want to weaken it."
2819,Elizabeth Warren,The @CFPB is widely popular with the American people – and widely hated by the big Wall Street banks it regulates.
2820,Elizabeth Warren,"The @CFPB is a tough watchdog for working families, forcing big banks to return more than $12B to people they cheated."
2821,Elizabeth Warren,"Transparency, pressure &amp; activism work. But we’re going to need a whole lot more of it to make @usedgov work for students."
2822,Elizabeth Warren,The DeVos aide who resigned last week? His dad happened to run the student loan company that sued @usedgov about that pro-borrower policy.
2823,Elizabeth Warren,The damage has already been done. @usedgov announced it would let student loan companies charge some struggling students outrageous fees.
2824,Elizabeth Warren,"The same day I wrote to DeVos about her aides’ obvious conflicts, one of them apparently resigned."
2825,Elizabeth Warren,I asked Betsy DeVos why 2 of her key aides are fmr for-profit college execs with massive conflicts of interest.
2826,Elizabeth Warren,Education Secretary Betsy DeVos apparently thinks her job is to hand @usedgov over to people who want to bilk students.
2827,Elizabeth Warren,Read my @BostonGlobe op-ed about why I oppose Neil Gorsuch’s nomination for the Supreme Court.
2828,Elizabeth Warren,We don’t need another Supreme Court justice to help giant corporations. We need a justice who will uphold equal justice for all.
2829,Elizabeth Warren,Glad to answer as many questions as possible during our office hours at CityStage in Springfield this morning.
2830,Elizabeth Warren,We had terrific office hours in Worcester this afternoon. I’m very glad so many people joined us to ask questions &amp; share their concerns.
2831,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump, your Muslim ban is now 0 for 2 vs the Constitution. Stop fighting the rule of law and start fighting for all Americans."
2832,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump's illegal Muslim ban is still a recruiting tool for ISIS. Still a betrayal of our values. Still doesn't keep us safe.
2833,Elizabeth Warren,"Turns out, an illegal Muslim ban by another name is still an illegal Muslim ban. So the courts just blocked @realDonaldTrump's second one."
2834,Elizabeth Warren,Now is the time to speak out about the importance of the ACA &amp; Medicaid to your family &amp; stop this cruel #Trumpcare bill in its tracks.
2835,Elizabeth Warren,"Today I told the Senate: If #Trumpcare passes, people will lose access to opioid recovery services. People will die."
2836,Elizabeth Warren,Gutting the ACA with #Trumpcare is like shoving a stick of dynamite in this country’s opioid treatment gap &amp; lighting the fuse.
2837,Elizabeth Warren,Consider what #Trumpcare will do to families &amp; communities struggling with the opioid crisis. We already have an opioid treatment gap.
2838,Elizabeth Warren,There's no other way to say it: #Trumpcare is just part of a GOP plan to help the rich get richer &amp; kick dirt in everyone else's face.
2839,Elizabeth Warren,Who thinks the central problem in America is that middle class families have too much health care &amp; rich people need more gov handouts?
2840,Elizabeth Warren,What kind of health care bill has as its central feature ripping insurance away from tens of millions of American citizens?
2841,Elizabeth Warren,About to speak about the devastating impact that #Trumpcare will have on fighting the opioid crisis in MA. Watch:
2842,Elizabeth Warren,Tune in tonight! #inners
2843,Elizabeth Warren,Throwing 24 million people off their health care to give billionaires a tax break is heartless &amp; irresponsible. We cannot pass #Trumpcare.
2844,Elizabeth Warren,"Alan on the South Shore worries about his daughter Meg, who needs Medicaid for her disability. What about her, @realDonaldTrump? #Trumpcare"
2845,Elizabeth Warren,"Olivia in North Reading has a chronic illness &amp; needs the ACA to stay alive. Will she be in the 24 million, @SenateMajLdr? #Trumpcare"
2846,Elizabeth Warren,"Denise from MA has 3 cancer survivors in her family of 4. Will they be in the 24 million who lose under #Trumpcare, @SpeakerRyan?"
2847,Elizabeth Warren,"MA residents have been writing, calling, emailing me – deeply worried about their health care. And they have every right to be worried."
2848,Elizabeth Warren,The budget experts' numbers are in: the GOP #Trumpcare plan will rip health coverage away from 24 million people.
2849,Elizabeth Warren,I’ll fight back as Republicans try to gut access to mental health &amp; substance use treatment by repealing ACA &amp; cutting Medicare &amp; Medicaid.
2850,Elizabeth Warren,Today I launched a survey of 70+ MA orgs for more info about resources they need to treat substance use disorders:
2851,Elizabeth Warren,"The incredible docs, nurses &amp; staff at Manet &amp; other community health centers are on the frontlines of our country’s opioid epidemic."
2852,Elizabeth Warren,This morning I visited Manet Community Health Center in Quincy – a critical health service provider for 15k people/yr in MA.
2853,Elizabeth Warren,"Newsflash, @realDonaldTrump: The Senate confirms US Attorneys. And you're not replacing real prosecutors with cronies w/out a massive fight."
2854,Elizabeth Warren,"You can't fire the rule of law, @realDonaldTrump. You can't shut down ongoing investigations by career prosecutors."
2855,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump wants people like AG Sessions – a loyalist who lied to the Senate about meeting with the Russians – in @TheJusticeDept.
2856,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump fired acting AG Sally Yates – who refused to defend his #MuslimBan &amp; had warned the WH about Flynn’s contact with Russia.
2857,Elizabeth Warren,GOP &amp; Dems respect Preet Bharara as a fearless prosecutor who stands up to both parties &amp; Wall Street. I guess that's why Trump fired him.
2858,Elizabeth Warren,"Preet Bharara had authority over Trump Tower. @realDonaldTrump called him directly, breaching protocol. 24 hrs later he was asked to resign."
2859,Elizabeth Warren,"Weeks ago, @realDonaldTrump promised to keep Preet Bharara as the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan. Yesterday, Preet was fired. Why?"
2860,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about getting corruption out of gov. But he wants a bunch of tame prosecutors who won’t investigate him.
2861,Elizabeth Warren,It’s time to junk this cruel #Trumpcare bill before massive numbers of Americans are hurt by it.
2862,Elizabeth Warren,A health care bill that destroys care &amp; affordable coverage for millions – seriously? What planet are these guys living on?!
2863,Elizabeth Warren,"Republicans seem intent on plowing ahead anyway – pretending down is up, left is right, &amp; #Trumpcare is somehow not a catastrophe."
2864,Elizabeth Warren,"Don’t forget patient advocates like @ACSCAN &amp; @AARPadvocates – they’re appalled by #Trumpcare, too."
2865,Elizabeth Warren,"The GOP have convinced people who never agree on ANYTHING – docs, hospitals, economists, even insurance companies: #Trumpcare is a disaster."
2866,Elizabeth Warren,Anyone who cares about access to mental health care benefits under the GOP health plan needs to watch @RepJoeKennedy’s video right now.
2867,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor now to talk about GOP efforts to rescind accountability regs of the ESSA edu bill:
2868,Elizabeth Warren,"I promise you this: We won’t stop fighting for women, families, &amp; working people – on #InternationalWomensDay or any other day."
2869,Elizabeth Warren,No day off for us today. Can you imagine what bills the @SenateGOP would try to ram through if 16 @SenateDems women skipped a day of work?
2870,Elizabeth Warren,I stand in solidarity with women across the country joining the #InternationalWomensDay #ADayWithoutAWoman strike today.
2871,Elizabeth Warren,@ByronTau
2872,Elizabeth Warren,I’m heading to the Senate floor now to speak out against GOP’s plan to repeal the Fair Pay &amp; Safe Workplaces order:
2873,Elizabeth Warren,"There’s a lot we could be doing to help US workers. Instead, the GOP wants to make it easier for giant gov contractors to hurt workers."
2874,Elizabeth Warren,Today’s debate on the Fair Pay &amp; Safe Workplaces order is about who Congress works for. I’m here to fight for workers – &amp; I’ll be voting no.
2875,Elizabeth Warren,"Instead of helping workers, the GOP will vote today to make it easier for companies that hurt workers to get massive gov contracts."
2876,Elizabeth Warren,My office released a report today that shows 2/3 of the top contractors have been caught breaking labor laws.
2877,Elizabeth Warren,The US gov pays billions to federal contractors – but some of the biggest corporations underpay workers &amp; put their health/safety at risk.
2878,Elizabeth Warren,Read the article @ChuckGrassley &amp; I wrote about our over-the-counter hearing aid bill in @JAMAInternalMed:
2879,Elizabeth Warren,".@ChuckGrassley &amp; I have a bipartisan bill to let some hearing aids be sold over-the-counter, saving families money &amp; reducing regulations."
2880,Elizabeth Warren,Met this morning with the terrific staff of Lynn Community Health Center. Their patients need the ACA for insurance &amp; Medicaid access.
2881,Elizabeth Warren,"When we’re #fightingforfamilies loud enough person-to-person, city-to-city, state-to-state, then DC can’t ignore these issues any longer."
2882,Elizabeth Warren,"And while the GOP continues to block #equalpay for equal work, state lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies."
2883,Elizabeth Warren,Businesses that cheat their workers must be held accountable. State lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies with bills to stop wage theft.
2884,Elizabeth Warren,A hard day’s work deserves a fair day’s pay. State lawmakers across the country are #fightingforfamilies with bills to expand overtime.
2885,Elizabeth Warren,And Massachusetts continues to lead the way in #fightingforfamilies with earned sick time &amp; the highest state minimum wage in the country.
2886,Elizabeth Warren,Massachusetts has shown that #fightingforfamilies can start in states. We did it with marriage equality &amp; health care reform.
2887,Elizabeth Warren,".@realDonaldTrump &amp; the GOP leadership aren’t #fightingforfamilies with policies like raising the min wage, overtime pay or fair scheduling."
2888,Elizabeth Warren,And we need Attorney General Jeff Sessions – who should have never been confirmed in the first place – to resign. We need it now.
2889,Elizabeth Warren,"We need a special prosecutor totally independent of the AG. We need a real, bipartisan, transparent Congressional investigation into Russia."
2890,Elizabeth Warren,This is not normal. This is not fake news. This is a very real &amp; serious threat to the national security of the United States.
2891,Elizabeth Warren,Now Jeff Sessions is AG – the final say on the law enforcement investigation into ties between the Trump campaign &amp; Russia? What a farce.
2892,Elizabeth Warren,Jeff Sessions answered “No.” Turns out he met with the Russian Ambassador. Two months before the election.
2893,Elizabeth Warren,"It's a simple q: ""Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election?"""
2894,Elizabeth Warren,I'd like for you to meet my guest to the #Jointsession speech tonight: @UMassD student &amp; Iraqi refugee Tiba Faraj.
2895,Elizabeth Warren,I can name a zillion reasons why MA is the best – but our schools &amp; health care are two very good reasons. Go MA!
2896,Elizabeth Warren,"For any and all these reasons, today I urged my colleagues to vote NO on Wilbur Ross for @CommerceGov."
2897,Elizabeth Warren,"Wilbur Ross has shady ties to Russia, serious business conflicts, &amp; a history of cheating people out of their homes."
2898,Elizabeth Warren,.@CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross is practically a cartoon stereotype of a Wall Street fat cat with no interest in anyone but himself.
2899,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenMarkey &amp; I wrote to 17 agencies about whether they’ll use Trump’s order to cut off funding for MA services.
2900,Elizabeth Warren,MA pays more in taxes than we get back in federal funds. But that money is at risk because of @realDonaldTrump’s order on local immigrants.
2901,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the Senate floor now to urge my colleagues to reject Wilbur Ross’s nomination for @CommerceGov. Watch:
2902,Elizabeth Warren,Every R who opposes extending debate today is responsible for whatever it turns out is in Pruitt's emails next week. Make the right choice.
2903,Elizabeth Warren,"Considering how obsessed @GOP are with emails, I'd hope they'd vote to extend debate on Pruitt until we can see his secret Big Oil ones."
2904,Elizabeth Warren,".@SenateGOP are jamming through Pruitt at @EPA before his emails come out. At 12:30pm, @SenateDems will force a vote to extend the debate."
2905,Elizabeth Warren,".@EPA nominee Scott Pruitt wouldn't provide his office's records of dealings with Big Oil, so a court ruled he must release them next week."
2906,Elizabeth Warren,I’m speaking on the Senate floor now to strong oppose Scott Pruitt to run the @EPA. Watch:
2907,Elizabeth Warren,"In the choice between corporate polluters &amp; people who want to breathe the air &amp; drink the water, Scott Pruitt sides with the polluters."
2908,Elizabeth Warren,Those emails might show corruption - so of course Republicans are jamming his confirmation through 4 days before the emails become public.
2909,Elizabeth Warren,"A few hours ago, a judge in OK ordered the release of thousands of emails on @EPA nominee Scott Pruitt's relationship with Big Oil."
2910,Elizabeth Warren,"This morning I joined 100s of workers who fought their hearts out to stop Andrew Puzder’s @USDOL nomination. Some days, the good guys win."
2911,Elizabeth Warren,My friend &amp; colleague @SenKamalaHarris has a new Senate twitter account! Follow her now to join our fight.
2912,Elizabeth Warren,Glad to meet with presidents &amp; trustees of MA community colleges to discuss ways the fed gov can support our schools &amp; invest in students.
2913,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the floor now to call on Puzder to withdraw &amp; urge my colleagues to vote no on Mulvaney for OMB. Watch:
2914,Elizabeth Warren,"Reports say that Andy Puzder is tired &amp; may withdraw his @USDOL nomination. If he can’t stand the heat, he should get out of the kitchen."
2915,Elizabeth Warren,"And on Monday, I sent Andy Puzder 28 pages of questions about his readiness to protect America’s workers."
2916,Elizabeth Warren,We detailed more stories from Andy Puzder’s mistreated workers in a report two weeks ago:
2917,Elizabeth Warren,We heard the stories of workers mistreated by Andy Puzder’s burger chains at a @SenateDems forum last month:
2918,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump ’s nominee for @USDOL - @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees CEO Andy Puzder – has made his fortune treating workers with total contempt.
2919,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP should stop these reckless actions to hurt the ACA before they hurt even more people who need health coverage.
2920,Elizabeth Warren,"When you shut down ads, fewer people sign up. Now Humana is pulling out of the exchanges. They don’t have enough healthy young ppl enrolled."
2921,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP have worked around the clock to sabotage health care: A vague ACA order. Repeal &amp; run. Pull the enrollment ads.
2922,Elizabeth Warren,"Congress must pull its head out of the sand and launch a real, bipartisan, transparent inquiry into Russia. Our natl security is at stake."
2923,Elizabeth Warren,When did @WhiteHouse know that Flynn lied? What other contacts with Russia occurred during the campaign? Who knew what? Who approved what?
2924,Elizabeth Warren,"This. Is. Not. Normal. @realDonaldTrump owes Americans a full account of his Admin’s dealings with Russia, both before &amp; after the election."
2925,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump is still making money overseas &amp; may have financial ties to Russia. Nobody knows since he STILL won’t release his taxes.
2926,Elizabeth Warren,.@StateDept Sec Rex Tillerson has close ties to Putin. @CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross has close financial ties to Putin buddies.
2927,Elizabeth Warren,Reports say our own intel agencies have corroborated parts of a dossier alleging that Russia has compromising info about @realDonaldTrump.
2928,Elizabeth Warren,This isn’t a game. Reports say the Russians conducted a series of successful cyber-attacks on our elections to help elect @realDonaldTrump.
2929,Elizabeth Warren,But American national security demands that we not allow Michael Flynn to become a scapegoat for this Admin's disturbing ties to Russia.
2930,Elizabeth Warren,Michael Flynn’s blinding religious hatred &amp; shady Russian ties disqualified him as NSA on day one. His removal is a win for American values.
2931,Elizabeth Warren,I will be voting NO on Steve Mnuchin’s confirmation for @USTreasury tonight. I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.
2932,Elizabeth Warren,"If Wall Street threatens to blow up the economy again, does anyone seriously expect Steve Mnuchin to tell his buddies to knock it off?"
2933,Elizabeth Warren,Personnel is policy. Hiring Mnuchin &amp; all these @GoldmanSachs execs shows @realDonaldTrump has no interest in reducing Wall St’s influence.
2934,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about Wall St - but he's hired enough @GoldmanSachs alums to open a new bank branch at the @WhiteHouse.
2935,Elizabeth Warren,.@realDonaldTrump said he’d be tough on Wall Street. That’s a broken promise. #TrumpsBrokenPromises
2936,Elizabeth Warren,"On Friday, the Senate unanimously passed my resolution congratulating the @Patriots on their Super Bowl victory. Go Pats!"
2937,Elizabeth Warren,I sent Andrew Puzder a 28-pg letter (83 q’s) about his readiness for @USDOL to protect America’s workers. https://t.co/FKuf9NgpvX
2938,Elizabeth Warren,Puzder’s company has the most discrimination suits of any major burger chain – the same laws he’d be charged with enforcing at @USDOL.
2939,Elizabeth Warren,.@CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees CEO Andrew Puzder made a fortune squeezing his workers – the same workers he’d be charged with protecting at @USDOL.
2940,Elizabeth Warren,.@SenSchumer’s concerns about Judge Gorsuch should worry everyone who cares about the independence of our courts.
2941,Elizabeth Warren,I’m speaking on the Sen floor now to urge my colleagues to vote NO on Steve Mnuchin's @USTreasury nomination.
2942,Elizabeth Warren,There’s nothing in Steve Mnuchin’s record to suggest he could stand up to Wall Street – or that he’d even want to stand up to Wall Street.
2943,Elizabeth Warren,Consider this MY warning: We won’t be silent. We will speak out. And we WILL persist.
2944,Elizabeth Warren,"And you better believe every Senator who voted to put Jeff Sessions’s radical hatred into @TheJusticeDept will hear from all of us, too."
2945,Elizabeth Warren,"If Jeff Sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism &amp; bigotry into @TheJusticeDept, he'll hear from all of us."
2946,Elizabeth Warren,"If Jeff Sessions turns a blind eye while @realDonaldTrump violates the Constitution or breaks the law, he'll hear from all of us."
2947,Elizabeth Warren,There’s no Rule 19 to silence me from talking about Jeff Sessions anymore. So let me say loudly &amp; clearly: This is just the beginning.
2948,Elizabeth Warren,"Thanks to you, everyone now knows the concerns that Coretta Scott King had about Jeff Sessions. Concerns that millions of people still have."
2949,Elizabeth Warren,Deeply disappointed that the Senate confirmed an AG whose record does not show he will faithfully &amp; fairly enforce the law.
2950,Elizabeth Warren,I’m deeply disappointed that the Senate voted to confirm Jeff Sessions as Attorney General tonight.
2951,Elizabeth Warren,.@AntiochCollege's Coretta Scott King Center is right: Mrs. King’s words about Sessions should be heard. Thank you.
2952,Elizabeth Warren,Thank you @SenSanders for reading Coretta Scott King's letter on the Senate floor. It is powerfully important.
2953,Elizabeth Warren,"THANK YOU to the police, clerks, stenographers, cloakroom staff, pages, &amp; Sen officers who worked all night while @SenateDems #holdthefloor."
2954,Elizabeth Warren,"Still banned from floor, but spoke w/ civil rights leaders this AM to say: Coretta Scott King will not be silenced."
2955,Elizabeth Warren,Thank you @SenSherrodBrown. Coretta Scott King will not be silenced.
2956,Elizabeth Warren,Many thanks to @SenatorTomUdall for reading Coretta Scott King’s letter on the Senate floor.
2957,Elizabeth Warren,Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for bringing Coretta Scott King’s words back to the US Senate.
2958,Elizabeth Warren,Tonight @SenateMajLdr silenced Mrs King's voice on the Sen floor - &amp; millions who are afraid &amp; appalled by what's happening in our country.
2959,Elizabeth Warren,I will not be silent while the Republicans rubber stamp an AG who will never stand up to the @POTUS when he breaks the law.
2960,Elizabeth Warren,I will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory &amp; racist comments that have no place in our justice system.
2961,Elizabeth Warren,I spoke out about @SenatorSessions – until @SenateMajLdr McConnell decided to silence me.
2962,Elizabeth Warren,"On the floor, I read a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing @SenatorSessions's judicial nomination:"
2963,Elizabeth Warren,"Tonight on the Senate floor, I tried to speak about why @SenatorSessions is totally unfit to serve as Attorney General."
2964,Elizabeth Warren,Heading to the floor to ask: where are the senators who will say no to @SenatorSessions for AG? Watch:
